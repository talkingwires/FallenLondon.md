## Menace Management
Menaces cannot easily be reduced at the Mangrove College, so you need to be careful.  It may be easier to return to London to completely remove menaces (you can tie this in when TtH hits for example).

[[Nightmares]] can be reduced on the Endless Bounty card, with a KT check.  However, this in turn raises [[Wounds]].

[[Wound]] reduction can be done through the black bordered card, which appears when you have a Yield of 3 or more.

Playing the Exploring the Mangrove College -> Explore the Wisp-Ways option can yield a rare success that reduces both [[Nightmares]] and [[Wounds]] by 2CP each, which is a useful alternative to travelling back to London if you wish to stay at the Mangrove College for an extended period of time.
