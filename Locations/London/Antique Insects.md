New week at the bone market. This time the fad is for antique insects.

An Insect:

- Has one head
- Has 6 legs
- Has no tail
- Has up to 0-4 wings

Being 'antique' week that means:
- An Investment Minded Ambassador, who's antiquity squared.
- ​An Author of Gothic Tales - who likes Antiquity x Menace
- A Zailor with Particular Interests, who likes Antiquity x Amalgamy.

And perhaps worth noting, that the Enthusiast of the ancient world is a non-exhaustion buyer, because he just buys linear amounts of antiquity. But you do get +1 for it being the right week. Still somewhat handy if you want a load of [[Bessemer Steel|Bessemer Steel Ingot]].

Our exhaustion breakpoints are for the single attribute 'squared' buyer (The Investment Minded Ambassador)
- ​4 Antiquity for 0 exhaustion
- ​7 Antiquity for 1 exhaustion
- 11 antiquity for 4 exhaustion.

And there's also the Enterprising Boot Salesman in town, looking for 'stuff with legs'. Pays in [[Whisper-Satin Scrap]] and [[Ostentatious Diamond]], neither of which are particularly desirable. (They're fine for 'market value' but they're not easily fungible to scrip, or good for feeding into more efficient echo-engines like the rat market).

So mostly I prefer not to bother, as they still cost exhaustion. (4 legs for zero exhaustion).

Insect Week you can use segmented frames, but I prefer not to - those are better for spider week IMO.

I feel Insect Week in general is a pretty good time to use any [[Ivory Femur|Ivory Femurs]]you've acquired, because a 15% bonus is highly relevant for a 64E bone. It's also nice to be able to cash in [[Sabre-toothed Skull]], or indeed [[A Custom-Engraved Skull|Engraved Skulls]] if you've exhaustion to spare.

So with that in mind, here's a nice Antique Insect with 0 exhaustion:

- [[Flourishing Ribcage]] - 2 amalgamy
- [[Sabre-toothed Skull]] - 1 menace, 1 antiquity (64E value)
- [[Carved Ball of Stygian Ivory|Stygian Ivory]] to cap off a neck
- 5x [[Femur of a Jurassic Beast]] - 1 antiquity each
- ​1x [[Ivory Femur]] (64E)
- 1x [[Jet Black Stinger]] - 2 menace
- Amputate the stinger (Insects have 0 tails)

This'll get you a 6x3 insect suitable for selling to the Author of Gothic Tails, for a nice bonus in stygian ivory (which can be sold at either the Khanate or the Upper River), as well as some scrip (which if you really need echoes, you can turn into tinned hams)

(The 'spider pope' guide would have this as a 'bulk' week if that's a thing you're following)
