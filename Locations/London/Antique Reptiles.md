You may have seem a similar post a little while ago. Turns out I'd got muddled and thought it was menace week. And it isn't. So here's a second attempt.

So, this week:

    Antiquity gets you a bonus payout.
    Reptiles are worth 10% more
    A dreary midnighter

Dreary midnighter isn't all that interesting to farm, so I'll skip over that.

Antiquity is a good week if you're doing "Tombs and Tigers". I'd suggest that's worth a read, as it's very extensive.

I won't reproduce it here, but look at:

    Fossilized Ape (Human skeleton, Fossilized forelimbs, horned skull)

Good profit - 9 antiquity, 2 menace means you get 22 Stygian Ivory instead of 18 (10E additional) and the ivory can either be turned straight into scrip.

Or sold at the khanate, used to buy crackling devices which you can then sell in the Rat Market.

Note: Fossilized Forelimbs require a really high Monstrous Anatomy to attach with 100% success, so payout might be lower.
Antique Reptile:

But the challenge for this week is to optimise yourself an antique reptile.

You'll need to have completed some research in the lab, to get your book about reptile anatomy.

To declare a reptile:

    One skull
    0-4 legs
    a tail

And you need a 'chassis' that isn't humanoid.

Sellers of note

    the Investment-Minded Ambassador, that gives you payoff for Antiquity - Antiquity 2.1 as your 'payout'.
    The Author of Gothic tales (as above) which gives you (Antiquity)* x (Menace+0.5) Stygian Ivory (2.5E each)

So with that in mind:

    Mammoth chassis (no menace, Antiquity 2)
    Jet Black Stinger (Menace 2)
    Sabre Toothed (Menace 1, Antiquity 1)
    3x Jurassic Thigh bones (3x1 Antiquity)
    1x any other non-menace, non antiquity bone. (Unidentified is probably easiest, but helical thighbone or ivory femur could work)

This gives us 6 antiquity, 3 menace, which is zero exhaustion for the Author, giving 21 Stygian Ivory (instead of 18). Also 303 scrip, with an unidentified femur.

We also get +10% on the value of the 62.5E mammoth frame, and the 62.5E sabre toothed skull, so that's another 12 E of payoff.

So overall 'bonus' payout (above the base value of bones) we've gained 52.5E of Ivory, and 12.5E of scrip. 65E of profit, for around 8 actions to assemble and sell is a very credible amount. (Of course overall EPA depends a lot on how efficiently bones were acquired, but they're usually 'reasonable').

For the investment minded ambassador, we need to keep antiquity below 4, for the payoff. But similar:

    Mammoth frame (antiquity 2)
    Tomb Lion Tail (Antiquity 1)
    Sabre Toothed Skull (Antiquity 1, menace 1)
    Any non-antiquity leg. (Unidentified thighbone is fine).

This will give you a non-exhausting 15 tailfeathers, brilliant as flame instead of 13. (2.5E each, so 5E profit)

If you swap to jurassic thighbones on this instead, you'll get to 8 antiquity, which will cost you 2 exhaustion, but give you 157.5 E of tailfeathers (which is +29.5E over the 'normal' payout of 128E) (312 memories of light, 63 Tailfeathers, brilliant as flame)

* Yes, it's the 'non-antiquity' state that's increased. That's because 6x 3.5 > 6.5x3
