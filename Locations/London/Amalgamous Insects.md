So - Insect week is round again. I like that one, because it lets me offload ivory femurs at a health margin.

Femurs cost 3 orange apples - 1100 bone fragments each*, so you need 40 or so E of bone fragments for each.

But they're worth 65E when attached to your skelly, and +15% if that skelly is an insect.

Flourishing Ribcages are good for Insects, because they come with 6 limbs in the first place. They also have room for an extra skull and a tail - neither of which are permitted on insects. (But you can add a tail and remove it again if you have a ravenglass knife, and gain the value + attributes).

So:

    Flourishing Ribcage
    Skull in Coral
    Styian Ivory for second 'head' (insects must have only one)
    No tail (or any tail if you have a ravenglass knife - probably not worth the 'action' cost to add and remove a cheap tail)
    6x Ivory Femur

That should get you a 42500 penny creature, with amalgamy 4.

Selling to the tentacled Entrepreneur this week means bonus payout, this will be worth:

    982 memories of distant shores
    74 final breaths.

491E primary, and 37E bonus reward.

Final Breaths can be sold directly for scrip at value.

Your major cost is in buying the femurs, as that's several actions to make orange apples - so 40E for 65E whilst good, isn't as good as it looks, as you need to spend 2 actions for each apple and +1 to 'sell' them to the bohemian sculptress and +1 to attach to the skeleton.

Other breakpoints are amalgamy 4 for 0 exhaustion, and 7 for 1 exhaustion. But it seems oddly difficult to get odd numbers of amagamy without failing checks. So maybe you want to just go for Amalgamy 8, and accept that's 2 points of exhaustion (8 is the upper limit for 2 exhaustion) for 128E -> 157.5E of bonus payout.

Another option is the Zailor with particular Interests who likes amagamy and antiquity.

That means you can assemble:

    Flourishing ribcage (2 amalgamy
    Skull in Coral (2 amalgamy
    Styian Ivory second head
    Helical Thighbone (2 amalgamy)
    2x Jurassic thighbone (1 antiquity each)
    3x Ivory Femur (65E raw value each)
    A tomb lion tail that you remove with a ravenglass knife. (1 antiquity; no tail + 300p)

This gives you 6 amalgamy, 3 antiquity, which is just below the exhaustion threshold, and will pay out 21 knobs of scintillack (instead of 18 normally, so 7.5E bonus). And because it's an insect, you're getting +15% on the base frame.

So 23900 skeleton value will get you:

    21 x Knob of Scintillack (52.5E)
    2774 x Nodule of Warm Amber (277.4E).

Knobs can be turned into Scintillack Snuff, which is why I'm wanting them, but the can also be sold in the upper river.

Warm Amber you've probably already used a reasonable chunk when bone-marketing, but not least because when you're duplicating bones in ealing (or adding more joints to your skeleton) it's using warm amber.

For a bonus 'grind' for ivory femurs: You can use an Augmented Electrostatic Machine if you have one, and grind hedonist making ballets at the Palace. The Pleasures of the Neath gives you 3CP of hedonist, 20CP of inspired, and you can use 100 bone fragments and 21CP of hedonist to generate 2 orange-apples. And of course you get the payoff in Tribute + materials for the ballet.
