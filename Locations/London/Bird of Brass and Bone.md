Birds of Brass&Bone from mp's Ranching guide are by far the most efficient method, and one of the fastest, too. The gist of it is that you wait for a Birds week on BM (ideally not Amalgamy) and construct skeletons like this: 7-necked frame, 5 Brass Skulls, 1 Plated Skull, 1 Sabre-toothed Skull, 2 Terror-bird wings.

This sells for 1166 Scrip to GothicTales, and you can reasonably build \~60 of those in a week, earning you a nice **70 000 scrip** at the cost of <19k Echoes in Brass Skulls. Replenishing the other materials takes around 12 days from what I've found.

I haven't bothered doing precise EPA on this, but I'd wager it's at least 5.5 EPA / 11 SPA in addition to the thousands of Echoes you're converting to scrip. To keep this post from getting too unwieldy, I'll only quickly mention the sources of relevant materials; you can read more about them in the guide (or just ask here, if you're unfamiliar with the sources).

* Sabre-skulls bought from BM
* Plated Skulls cloned in Ealing (best with biscuits via BM or Helicon House)
* Nevercold Brass from Sunken Embassy
* 7-necked and wings from Balmoral
* Unprovenanced Artefact (needed for 7-necked in Balmoral) from Moulin (Expeditions->Monographs)
* Hastily-Written Notes and Suspicion clears from an alt

The main drawback is that this entire process is a bit more involved than most simple conversions, so it's only really great for large-scale investments like Hellworm. But it's excellent for those projects.
