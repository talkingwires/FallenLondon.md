# Acquisitions 
- In the Khanate, you can purchase them in the market for 130 x  Assortment of Khaganian Coinage or through the storylet Commission the manufacture of a Crackling Device for 60 x  Assortment of Khaganian Coinage and 3000 x  [[Nevercold Brass Sliver]]. Coinage can be gained e.g. by selling skeletons in the Khanate.
- Perform intrigue at the khanate. This should take 15 actions per crackling device (1 to start, 13 to build, and 1 to cash out). This is airs dependent as only A Repentant Thief gives these directly, but there are other options which instead gives Coinage. See [Khaganian Intrigue (Guide)](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Khaganian_Intrigue_(Guide)).
- Do the grind at L. B. Industries. This should take 21 actions per crackling device. (1 to start, 19 to build, and 1 to cash out). See [L. B. Industries (Guide)](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/L._B._Industries_(Guide)).
