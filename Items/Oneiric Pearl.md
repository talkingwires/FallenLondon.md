# Acquisitions
- Perform intrigue at the khanate - this should take 15 actions per Oneiric Pearl. (1 to start, 13 to build, and 1 to cash out.) Again, this is dependent on the airs cooperating and giving you A Radical Physician. See [Khaganian Intrigue (Guide)](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Khaganian_Intrigue_(Guide)).
- Perform intrigues at the Khanate with Strength of your Khaganian Network 20, which should take 12 actions per Oneiric Pearl. (1 to start, 10 to build, and 1 to cash out.) This is only available for one pulling threads option, Leave him in his state, which means you will have to do other options as well and this will probably not be very efficient. See[ Khaganian Intrigue (Guide)](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Khaganian_Intrigue_(Guide)).
- All the main zee dreams provide one upon completion. See [Zailing (Guide)](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Zailing_(Guide)).
