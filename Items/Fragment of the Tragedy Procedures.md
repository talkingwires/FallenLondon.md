# Acquisitions
- The main source of these are through a heist unlocked with Flask of Waswood Wellspring Water from Moulin Expeditions. First these must be acquired, then search Parabola for the location of a particular treasure (see Parabolan Hunting (Guide)). Finally you will have to go on a perilous heist to steal from The shaded estate on Hemlock Row. It's hard to estimate the efficiency in gathering these, but if an estimate on Moulin Expeditions (Guide) suggests around 150 actions in order to gather 6, but there will be some variation and there's a slight risk of failing the heists.
