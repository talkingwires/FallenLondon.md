## Acquisitions
- Tricksters receive them as part of their weekly professional reward.
- Use a Gang of Hoodlums to steal [[Journal of Infamy|Journals of Infamy]] and cross-convert until you have [[Correspondence Plaque]]; then up-convert to Threnodies. If you do not have a Gang of Hoodlums, you can still steal the Journals, of course, but it will take more actions.
- Depending on how Dangerous you are, it might be more profitable to convert Threnodies all the way up from Primordial Shrieks. These can be earned in Coil 2 of the Labyrinth of Tigers, or through &quotHunting dangerous prey&quot in Wolfstack Docks [2160 Shrieks for one Spider-Council!](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/This_will_take_work)!
- You can exchange 500 Cryptopalaeontological Notes for 4 Threnodies
- If you have an Overgoat or Übergoat, its opp card has an option that can provide you with a Storm-Threnody.
- Favouring Urchins over The Widow on their Conflict Card gets you 2 Threnodies.
- End-game Correspondents can grind them at Station VIII 2
