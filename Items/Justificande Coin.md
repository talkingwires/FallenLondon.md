# Acquisitions

The easiest way of gaining these coins is to Intervene in a Dockers' Brawl at [[The Blind Helmsman]], and choose the coffer of Admiralty coinage as a reward. Fighting on your own will net you 2 coins in 3 actions (if you succeed in all skill-checks). Fighting with any of the factions will give 1 coin per 3 actions, but has lower Dangerous checks.

Another way is within [[The Chessboard|The Chessboard in Parabola]]. Allow yourself to be sacrificed and you will gain one (1) coin. As a bonus, you can also train in [[A Player of Chess]] this way.

An alternative involves a heist of The home of an Admiral's Widow. This heist requires 3 [[Docks]], at three coins per run.

After you build the [[Ealing Garden|Ealing Garden station]], you get much better option in A Gift from the Capering Relicker, who will give you three (3) Justificande coins per gift, along with others.
