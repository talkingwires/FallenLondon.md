# Notable Sources
## [The Whisker-Ways](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/The_Whisker-Ways_(Guide)#Strategy)
Pick Myth of Invention. Ideally get Mythic Potential to 125; otherwise, at least 63. This will gain you one (or two, with 125) [[Bejewelled Lens]]. After you return to London, wait to draw The Tower of Sun and Moon, and have Dinner in your Room, which will gain an average of +70 CP [[Making Waves]]. You'll also get some profit from the other resources you gain.
