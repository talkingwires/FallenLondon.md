_The Thirsty Croupier lays out a tarot card. "Sometimes the cards are esoteric. Sometimes they're not. Looks like you, doesn't it? And here you are."_

Airag from the Year of the Tortoise is notoriously expensive, but it pales in comparison to the Year of the Serpent. Nobody can afford it. It has not even finished fermenting yet; it exists only as a commodity for the future. If the Thirsty Croupier can be believed, it exists in _your_ future. When will the legendary airag be ready to drink? Are the rumours about its ingredients true? Consult the cards. Interpret the spread. Taste a delicacy that does not yet exist.
