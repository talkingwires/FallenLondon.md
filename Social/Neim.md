>> Good day,  dear sir! I seem to have stumbled  your message, in my relentless search f.. flaming knowledge. I have come with an ... request: I wanted to ask if it could be ..... to receive a poetic missive... the court is really stingy about .... rewards, and even more stingy about a certain language. After all ... sleepless nights, the sweat poured in my works, hours wasted ... thinking to dam...d symphony ! For the payment, your wish ...... command! Ask and I will ..., my hungry housemate permitting it. I'll eagerly wait ... your answer, Regards .... P.s. if you see some strange cuts on the letter, please do ... mind them. My little .... is a bit difficult these days! Do you happen to know a way to ... a cat? For petting it, obviously!

> I've composed a Poetic Missive
> Your symphony will surely have my backing
> But the postmaster is not permissive
> Disclosing, “They‘ve a certain quality lacking.”

>> *Neim has elected to keep secret the information you gained while loitering. There's a lot to learn from your mark's mistakes, but only if nobody else knows them.*
>> "Ah, it's a long story - at the beginning I found only some pastries less, or jams, or cheddar wheels...and a bite or two on my cravat or other clothes. But I thought that it had to be some rat - or some other critter around here. At some point, when I had this strange obsession to uncover more rumors about a certain cat - I discovered that it was him all along! A. Single. Cat. So I asked to someone who knew the blasted animal well to send him my way, so that I could bake- *cough* admonish him. Even if I heard that there is a famous recipe in a foreign country called dragon, tiger, phoenix and I admit that I'm pretty curious... but I'm off-topic. Back to the cursed cat! I had to do something - least I found my pantry empty and clothes gnawed, so I thought to follow that saying: keep your friends close and your enemies closer. And gunshots are perfect to keep him off the pantry when I'm home. The neighbours are used to it too. In short, I can at least have a modicum of control of him now. And he doesn't gnaw on my hat any longer! And he's happy to not have to scavenge food anymore... well, we have a hate-love relationship now. More hate than love, but that's life! And that's not to speak also of my little toothy plant. Are you perhaps plagued by something too? "
>
>Your neighbors are unperturbed by the sounds of gunfire coming from just next door? Either they've gone deaf from the noise, are more terrified of your cat than the chance of catching a stray bullet!
>As always, I've been plagued by Scandal. That is, until I made the most remarkable discovery in my Laboratory last night. By taking a brief break from my research and meditating on my (too numerous!) extraditions to the Tomb Colonies, my Scandal evaporates into the aether! Talk about mind over matter!
> My preparations for the Parabola project are complete, thanks to your tip the Rat Market would be receptive to Captivating Ballads this weekend. The required resources are now all committed to the project, and frankly, the ordeal of gathering them probably created some psychological Repressions of Light which my therapist’ll have to untangle in the future. But that‘s a can of worms I‘ll kick down the road, for now Parabola awaits!
> How about you, what endeavors are you working towards?

>> *You have received a letter from Neim. You now have 1 x Improvised Dueling Manual.*
>> "I hope this will be of some help...well, you know that the wheels need turning, don't you? Death aside, I discovered in a certain place that there seems to be the option of doing a certain Ambition: Enigma - it isn't finished, and probably it'll never be, but I found its contents interesting. Ah, I will also send a little gift - to help with the Fool obviously..."
>
> Thanks!
> Speaking of Ambitions, the arrival of Hallowmas came not a moment too soon, keeping my Scandal in check this week as I made preparations for my masterpiece: the completion and performance of Tristan Bagley’s unfinished opera!
> Well, most of it, anyway. During the final aria, I was dragged from the stage, banished from Court, and deposited on the very next boat heading to the Colonies one last time. Now that I'm back, I intend to spent Hallowmas tying up loose ends here in London before zailing to Port Carnelian to begin my term as governor, and then Polythreme to follow my Ambition.
> Is it truly an Enigma, if its creator lacked the ambition to complete it? It could just be failure of the imagination, or a dangling thread to pull at later. There are many other avenues to explore here in the Neath. Any in particular that you are following?

>> *You have received a letter from Neim. You now have 1 x Revisionist Missive.*
>> "All is well, my friend, as all shall be... so, are you ready for sackmas? And the advent calendar should start soon... I'm wondering if something will happen - like during the Horticultural Show... I heard that this year it should be a little different from the other Sackmas... Ah, but how unbecoming of me to talk to you like this: would you be in the mood to converse over a cup of tea? It's my treat."
>
> Are you suggesting something untoward might happen during the festivities? Well, that's seems exciting. Sometimes, this time of year becomes a little *too* cheery, you know?
> 
> This will actually be my first Sackmas in the Neath, and I think I'm prepared! I'll tell you all about it, but I must first compose my thoughts. I’ll set the scene before I go.
> 
> I heard rumors that during Sackmas, there were ways to upgrade certain Lodgings, for the right price. Trouble was, my Townhouse is not among those, and sellers of properties that *were* are very particular about the goods they will accept. So, I put together a Gang of Hoodlums and we began a spree of revenge and burglaries against properties belonging to a certain raiper-weilding Tomb-Colonist, Feducci, that just so happened to have a stockpile of the Antique Mysteries I needed. His was a name I've grown to resent as the Devourer of Running Battle, down at Wolfstack Docks…

>>*Neim is keeping a strict watch over a certain building for many hours. They request your assistance in the matter.*
>>"Ah, I see... I wish you the best of luck for your high-end burglaries then! I can understand your resentment, I also tried to kill Feducci but he can't manage to remain dead. Every time he dies, I'll see his yellowy and lousy bandages on the morrow. Such a troublesome fellow. I saw that he seems to have a bit of Cider always with him... I would like to advise you against a room in that mysterious hotel, I heard that some guests like to visit other bedrooms through the mirrors at night. Well, maybe if you have accrued some favors from beings that belong to the world behind the mirror, you could probably let them guard your sleep. I found that, even if a bit particular in their customs, the Fingerkings seems pretty reliable...once you offered them a weasel or two - or maybe a bit more? I'm pretty sure that if you add some Parabolan Orange-apple it'll do the trick! As for Sackmas, someone told me that the other years there were also particular lodgings available, even if a bit far from London... but it seems that they''ll permit you to stay out of the city's problems. And to not suffer anymore when your neighbour decide to cook an absolutely abysmal fungal cake - it has the bad habit to mess the digestive system and the mental one. And you'll have to endure the smell and the yowls of someone who can't help himself but recite fungal-themed poetry. Don't ask me how I know it."
>
>Took me longer than I anticipated to gather my thoughts. Here's the rest of my story, as best as I recall…
>
>Last night, the Gang and I celebrated our final job with drinks at the Bridge Without, and after pocketing the final Antique Mystery and saying my farewells, I set out for the darkest corners of Fallen Quarter with a Woesel in my pocket. Next thing I recall is the press of a crowd, and I am picking my way towards any stovepipe hat I see peaking above the throng. Under one such hat, I catch a glint of bright, brass buttons and the man wearing them gives me knowing wink. I slip Feducci’s stolen Mysteries from my pocket, and press the bundle towards the man.
>
>His eyes widen, first in surprise. Around his mouth are creases that quickly rise to follow, pulling back lips which slide over one tooth, then the others. Widening, beaming, he wears a smile that nearly outshines those buttons.
>
>His hands are closing around mine and the bundle within, his smile continuing to grow, yet somehow never quite reaching his eyes.
>
>His hands are closing… and oh, and how he *beams!* Simply brilliant.
>
>His hands are closing, it is *so* very bright…
>
>…my hands are opening, revealing a hotel key. I am in the lobby of the Royal Bethlehem, checking into my room. Red wallpaper envelopes me, and in the gas light, its inlaid filagree has a peculiar, brassy gleam. It feels like coming home.

2023-11-30

> My experiences at the Royal Bethlehem have been exemplary, at least so far. Except for a certain bellhop, who became miffed when I insisted on carrying my boxes upstairs myself. My profession is Silverer, you see, and the boxes contains many delicate mirrors, which I was afraid he would treat carelessly. Now, he makes snide remarks under his breath about the delicacy of the serving platter when he brings meals to my room.
> 
> Actually, there could very well be reason to fear mirrors in London. I was completing my work in the Labyrinth of Tigers when I took pity on a certain individual, one that *appeared* to be a man, and I helped escape. But after I unlocked his cage he told me a horrific story about lurking behind every mirror, then loped off before I could change my mind and shove him back into the cage. I am familiar with the Fingerkings but do not believe this… entity to be associated with them.
> 
> A mental digestive system? Now, that's food for thought! The fungal cakes do sound dreadful, so perhaps I’ll maintain residence within London!

> Warmest regards,

>> *Neim has elected to keep secret the information you gained while loitering. There's a lot to learn from your mark's mistakes, but only if nobody else knows them. You've gained 2 x Hastily Scrawled Warning Note (new total 10). Shadowy is increasing...*
>> "What a fascinating tale! I must admit that I admire your bravery, as the Manager is... well, every time that I meet him I have the feeling that he could squish me like a Glim-Bug if he wanted to. When I meet his gaze, his little beady eyes send a chill upon my spine. It's only an hunch, but one I have little doubt to trust. As for Sackmas, the Advent Calendar is here finally, even if I'm anxiously waiting to snatch a room in the spires of the Bazaar. At least there there will be enough space to house all the critters I came to possess. I arleady planned to have a priso-*cough* room for the cat, a room for my evergreen and toothy friend, a room sealed with Misfortune-Proof Talismans for my Woesel...and I decided to keep a perch in the study for my Forty-Nine Warbler, I found that it's a pleasure to discuss politics and what-not with it (them?)... it has several unique and interesting views, one for each Sibilant voice! The only downside is that it believes himself a snake instead of a bird, and so it insists to have a Cosmogone-filled Mirrorcatch Box near its nest - to bask in the light after a good meal. A rat-based meal. I find myself surprised every time from how those little beaks manage to swallow such fatty rats... "
>> 
>> *You have received a letter from Neim. You now have 1 x Improvised Dueling Manual.*
>> "In the meantime, to shorten the wait, I began to decorate my house for Sackmas: I prepared some candied Parabolan Orange-Apples, I put some Foxfire Candles here and there and, in the place of a Christmas Tree, I hung some Shards of Glim and Moonpearls on my evergreen friend - you wouldn't believe how happy it was! I never thought that plants could be so vain... if you want to pay a visit, you'll recognize my apartment for the dead rats wrapped with a Red Ribbon on the door, I prepared them for Mr. Sacks in the case he'll visit. You're free to came for a cup of tea or two when you want, but I suggest to put some Rubbery Pies in your suit/dress before you cross the door... unless you want to launch a new Gnawed-Clothes fashion when you leave."
>
> As fate would have it, I have become better acquainted with the Manager when I recently endeavored to release him from a promise he made to the King of Polythreme. Of course, this was in service of larger goal, though perhaps, not a *greater* goal. I need him to play a round of cards, you see. Well, probably not, it is a long and complicated story. Let’s just say he will play a part in furthering Ambitions!
> 
> Your growing menagerie sounds lovely, though I do worry about associating with that particular cat. I’ve heard rumors it whispers things to people in the night, even driving some mad by searching for a particular Name. Perhaps you will consider sleeping with ear plugs? The Warbler, on the other hand, seems positively delightful! I was just in Parabola myself hunting Albatrosses, but did not happen to see any Warblers during my treks through the jungle. Probably for the best, at least for the Warbler’s sake. Those under my care tend to wander into my lab, and usually just when I’m trying to think of a new experiment.
> 
> I’d say I hope the holidays are finding you well, but from your description of those decorations, they surely are! I'd love to swing by and see them for myself!

>>*Neim has sent you a Christmas Card featuring a Fogscape with Tentacles. It's brought a little light into your life. CORPSELIGHT! But cheery corpselight. Watchful is increasing... You've gained 3 x Sudden Insight (new total 6). Making Waves has increased to 14!*
>>"Thank you for the notes, my friend. They were really inspiring. Don't worry for the cat, it doesn't whisper - it only eats and eats... and eats (important things must be repeated three times)! It also tries to gnaw the gnawable, with clothes as the major victims... and it's for this that, in the last letter, I wrote you to put Rubbery Pies in your dress/suit if you'll come to visit - it seems that it's the only thing that the darned feline doesn't dare to eat. But let's not talk about the cat! The other day I received a peculiar Christmas Card. I've never thought that one could be cut in a Woesel shape! The only downside is that it seemed to trasmit misfortune like its furry counterpart...as when I went to control the mailbox, other than the postcard, I happened to see eight little beady eyes looking at me. The little critter had one of his long and hairy legs on the card and when I tried to grab a corner, to make it slowly slide towards me, the stubborn thing put another appendage on the opposite one with a possessive glint in his multiple eyes. I could swear that I also heard it hiss. In the end I had to make a bargain for the card and I offered up 8 Lizards ... and now the arachnid seems to have taken a liking towards my mailbox. I hope that it'll decide to move soon. Anyways, on the card there was this: "The unluck-proof talismans won't stop me! Freedom for the Woesels!" "

>> *Neim has sent you a Christmas Card featuring a Paint-Besplattered Mog. Consider its rosy rage: learn from the burning anger in its smoky yellow eyes. Grow strong. You've gained 3 x Hard-Earned Lesson (new total 6). Dangerous has increased to 144 - Terrifying! Making Waves is increasing... You've lost a quality: Wounds.*
>>  "And my woesel seems indeed to have disappeared! There was also something strange near the door... a brass button so shiny that I could see my beheaded reflex on hit! Don't worry, I did not die, it's only my Parabolan copy that likes to make creepy jokes - after a while you get used to it. I suspect that the Woesels' base could be near the Royal Bethlehem Hotel, maybe someone is experimenting some curses against the Maste-*cough*... be careful! And if you have a Woesel - protect it well, I'm not sure that mine went away on his own volition..."
>
>Oh, no! You seem to have the most unusual luck when it comes to animals! Perhaps ladening one’s pockets with pies only attracts the most ravenous and ill-tempered fauna? Then again, most of what I know of Neathly animals was learned with a microscope in my Lab, so what do I really know?
>
>I’ve sent along this mystery box, which I have heard sometimes contains a cat of a more gentle disposition. Or, a Blemmington whose disposition is… less so. Or, maybe even another Starvling Cat, in which case, perhaps they will… cancel each other out? Let me know how it goes!

> Just a quick missive, Neim. I just received distressing news from another acquaintance that they are going NORTH, which I suppose means it's unlikely I'll hear from them ever again.
> 
> That peculiar cat is not still hanging around, is it? If so, gird your ears! Hmmm, that does not have the same ring as “gird your loins.” Nonetheless, take whatever precautions are necessary so you do not succumb to a similar madness!

>> "Thank you for the gifts! I'm afraid I cannot accept any more as I don't have the spare materials necessary for a fair exchange. I wish you a good Feast of the Rose!"

> Don’t sweat it, they are gifts, freely given! Well, perhaps the Remorseless Criminals and Plump Vicars I led into the Labyrinth of Tigers to obtain the necessary materials would disagree, but I don’t hear them complaining. Or screaming. At least, anymore.

> Another trip to the Elder Continent, and I can send more your way, no strings attached, unless you’d rather I not.
