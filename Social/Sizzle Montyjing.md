>Thanks! I will try to expedite the Expedition, as quickly as I can. Here's the plan:
>
> 1. Sold the few Uncanny Incunabulum and Fourth City Echos I had on hand to the Rat Market, picked up Compromising Documents and Inklings of Identities, did some upconverting.
> 2. Headed to the Clay Quarters, currently pressing the entire population into service as Strong-Backed Labor.
> 3. Next up, the Fallen Quarter to trade ‘em in for Supplies.
> 4. I need a few more points in Archaeologist to hit Level 5 and do the Cave of Nadir. Most expeditions only give one or two CP, but I actually have one related to my Ambition that I’d been dallying on doing because it gives zero rewards. It does, however, give 4 CP in Archaeologist! 
> 5. If that does not max out Archaeologist, run a quick one like the Thieve’s Cache.
> 
> If you know any way to speed things up, lemme know! I’m trying to relieve you of the Skull as quickly as possible, because I hear they add some nasty cards to your deck. Speaking of which, how does one happen to have an Eyeless Skull just laying around? I’ve Wandered the Quarter, Seen many of its Sights, and even ventured into the Shrine of the Deep Blue Heaven, yet never stumbled upon a single Skull. Are they common later in the game?

> Well, I made good progress sourcing Supplies, but my Ambition expedition left me two CP shy of what I needed to reach Archaeologist 5. So, I did an expedition to Deep Blue Heaven, which awards 2 CP, and you won't believe it, I found an Eyeless Skull at the end! So, I'm good to finally progress towards the Cave of Nadir!
