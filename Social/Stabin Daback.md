>> *Responding to a Calling Card Stabin Daback* "Esteemed talkingwires, It would bring me everlasting pleasure if you would grace me by accepting the hand that I humbly extend to you in friendship, with almost certainly no intention of murdering you while you sleep, robbing you while you sleep or writing a lascivious haiku upon your visage while you sleep. Awaiting your response in the hope of mutual benefits this might bring us. Delicious regards, Lord Stabin Daback"
>
> Pleased to meet you! Your nocturnal tendencies should not be an issue, as my Nightmares keep me up though the night, and a shouts from throngs my detractors from Court occupy the morning hours. But I remain determined to express the Correspondence through symphony, even if it means the occasional brick through the window!

>> *Stabin Daback has invited you to share a pot of tea at Beatrice's tea shop.*
>> "Dear talkingwires, It would be my pleasure if you could join me over a pot of brew at B's, as I'd love to get better acquainted with you. I am afraid that I have not slept well recently, and I seem to be plagued by nightmares of unusual frequency and vividness. Therefore, a sincere friend willing to listen to my woes would be highly appreciated. In return, I would happily offer whatever assistance such an individual might require themselves. I look forward to hearing from you, and remain Deliciously yours, Lord S. Daback"
>
> Certainly! In fact, my social calendar is rather light these days and I have several Free Evenings, if you wish to meet again. Nightmares have given me trouble, too, but most recently Scandal has been the worst. My labors at Court—an entire suite of Correspondent symphonies—earned me several trips to the Tomb Colonies, so the arrival of Hallowmas arrival was a godsend!
> In fact, this week I was able to perform my masterpiece: Tristan Bagley’s unfinished opera! Well, most of it, anyway. During the final aria, I was dragged from the stage, banished from Court, and deposited on the very next boat heading to the Colonies. Now that I'm back, I intend to spent Hallowmas tying up loose ends here in London before zailing to Port Carnelian to begin my term as governor, and then Polythreme to follow my Ambition.
> How about you? There are many avenues to explore in the Neath. Which are you following?

> 	How'd Hallowmas treat you? This was my first, and discovered I lacked a sufficient stockpile of resources to grind Spirit efficiently. Live and learn, I suppose.
>
> Is there any particular quality you are looking to raise through Letters? Also, my Salon is now up and running, I don't suppose that you are an Author in need of a speaking engagement?

>>Stabin Daback has invited you to share a pot of tea at Beatrice's tea shop.
>>"Dear talkingwires, Please do not take my slow reply to your kind messages as a sign of aloofness or, Neath forbid, disinterest in maintaining communication with you. It's simply that I have had a most strenuous Hallowmass which caught me fully by surprise (my first as well), and I found myself on a number of round-fare trips both to the beloved and often-visited Tomb Colonies, and to a peculiar sort of habitation of a jungley and Marchy variety, which I found particularly inviting, fascinating and well-worth visiting again. Alas, that also meant that I've felt rather out of myself, plagued by most unsettling nightmares, which is why I opted for staying indoors and limiting my social activities until I've felt better. Now that I can once again vouchsafe for my sanity, I'll be more than happy to get to know you better. In response to your inquiry, I indeed happen to be an Author, and I'd love to both test the chaise longue and taste the port (or any other fortfied wine you happen to have in stock) in your newly-acquired Salon. If my stories manage to regail your other guests, all the better. Do feel free to drop me a calling card next time you decide to host a soiree. Deliciously yours, Lord S. Daback "
>
>Sorry my response is also so delayed. I was at Zee, having pursued my Ambition in Polythreme, when I chanced upon a ragtag flotilla of privately owned ships, who claimed they'd assembled to counter a Lifeberg approaching London. I decided to join them in arms against the threat, and set course for the Salt Steppes. There, I attacked the Lifeberg, hewing off large chunks of fleshy ice with improvised rockets, following the great mass as it wound through the Sea of Voices and Shepard’s Wash. I’ve returned to London only briefly, to rearm and patch my leaking hull.
>
>It's unfortunate that you've been waylaid so often, and in such a short span of time. I've found that working late into the night on my Laboratory affords opportunities to reduce all sorts of Menaces, including Nightmares, which I previously had no simple remedy to counter.
>
>I‘ve sifted through my Cards, but did not find one for my Salon. I shall let you know when an opening next becomes available. Are there any particular Skills you seek to improve? I have a stack of envelopes, but no letters to send.

>>"Dear Wires, (Hopefully my familiarity in addressing you does not offend). What an exciting zee story! I hope that this message reaches you prior to your embarking, as I would like to buy you another round to celebrate the purchase of my own first vessel that I bought yesterday. She might be a decrepit rust bucket, but she will suffice for a novice captain like myself. I felt that it is time for me to experience the zee firsthand, and your story could not have come at a better time, as it sent my heart pumping with anticipation of what awaits me neath the waves. When it comes to attributes, my weakest one is Shadowy, but do not feel obliged to do anything about it, as I am rather low on resources, and can't guarantee that I would be able to return the favour. You can, however, count on me helping you with any menaces that might trouble you. Just send a note and I'll be there (unless the call of the waves or the drownie lifestyle proves too alluring for me hahaha). Until we meet again, I wish you smooth sailing. Stabin."
>
>A ship of your own? How exciting, I’m so happy for you! Although, that is slightly tempered by your enthusiasm for what awaits you *beneath* the waves, which is a worrisome thing to pursue in vessel designed to keep one safe and dry and, most importantly, *above* the waterline. I would suggest that you endeavor to keep yourself afloat, at least as long as possible, if you wish to see the wonders waiting just over the horizon.
>
>My own vessel will remain docked, for the time being, now the threat of the Lifeberg has passed. Originally, I had intended to zail for Polythreme, again, to pursue a major breakthrough in the Jack of Smiles case. Would you believe the perpetrator of those murders is not a man, but a common household item? I certainly didn't, and hope to find a definitive answer on that strange island, where clothing and even buildings are alive…
>
>Where was I? Oh, yes. Another Londoner graciously offered me an Eyeless Skull so that I might begin an expedition to discover the location of the Cave of Nadir. Only, I needed to complete a shorter expedition first, before I could accept it. And, wouldn't you know it, I chanced upon another Eyeless Skull along the way! I almost couldn't believe my luck, that is, until I discovered the things are cursed! Now, I must rush preparations for another expedition, before the Skull's evil can affect me further!

>> "Dear Wires, Should you have some free time, please join me for a cup of hot tea at B's, as I'm eager for something to warm my bones after getting back from my first zailing trip. Although it was just a hop to Hunter's Keep and back, it took a lot of time and effort, and I feel positively parched for some good brew and even better company. Deliciously yours, Lord Stabin"
>
>There, and back again, eh? Did you happen to get a look down that well while you were on Hunter’s Keep? I believe I lost my pocketwatch there last time I visited…
>
>So, any plans for your next voyage? Polythreme isn’t too far away, but I find the island and inhabitants maddeningly obtuse. I was just there—again!—to put a bow on the Jack of Smiles case. But one might go to Polythreme with the simplest of questions, or smallest of issues that any one resident could easily resolve, and at no personal cost to themselves. If they were so inclined, that is.
>
>Alas, the residents of Ploythreme are not so inclined. To even get the time of day, they insist you parade through their streets all afternoon, looking a fool as sentient scarves or some such try to trip you up.
>
>No, if you are in possession of a Screaming Map, I suggest setting course for Polythreme, then in the Sea of Voices, changing it to the Khanate. You’ll save yourself a Salt-Steppe Atlas, he Copper Quarter is quite lovely, and a certain a London diplomat who is quite keen on Palaeontological Fads. Deep pockets on that one!
>
>Oh, before I forget, there’s an opening coming up at my Salon. No date yet, or even a topic! Your previous engagement went so well, perhaps you should choose it? That is, of course, if you wish to attend!

>>"Dear Wires, Thank you for the suggestion of the lovely scenic route for my next zailing trip, I'll make sure to take your advice into consideration when I next chart my course with my navigator. By all means, it would give me immense pleasure to speak in your Salon again, and I hope that your guests will not be all too scandalized by the lovely little fanciful short story about a fiery tryst between the Bushy-bearded Ghillie and the Unnamed Monarch that I would like to premiere on that occasion. Please find enclosed some (obviously false) pieces of information I had used as inspiration while writing the story, and do not hesitate to inform me should you find the topic too unsavoury. Kind regards, Lord Stabin"

>> "Season's greetings, dear Wires! I wish you a month of merriment, mirth and muddled constabulary. Deliciously yours, Lord S. P.S. I thoroughly enjoyed the other evening in your Salon. It was a great opportunity to chew the fat between zailing trips, as I currently find myself visiting different islands in an effort to update my scientific notes. And the zee air really does wonders for my skin. "

>In my travels, I happened to pick up a stowaway, a certain Naturalist who also has penchant for scientific voyages. Perhaps you acquainted with him, too? He sent me on an errand to Hunter's Keep. Strange the Ladies keep hiding Keys down there, how many do they have? And, although I thoroughly searched that Well, I still did not find my lost pocketwatch. Alas!

>>"Dear Wires, I've been meaning to invite you over for a while, and it is now the perfect opportunity to see if you would be so kind as to join me for a Private Supper at my lodgings. I wanted to speak with you about the prospect of having someone as distinguished as yourself grace the front-page interview with their stories in the next print of the newspaper I have recently started. Would you care to be the focus of the next issue of The Voices Beneath? I'm sure my growing readership would revel in whatever personal information or professional advice you chose to share with them. Word of advice: please accept the invitation for the Supper (should you wish to) only once you are fully rested and without anything troubling your mind, as the recipe I'll try out is said to be rather hair-raising, and I'd hate to see you suffer from extensive nightmares. Kind regards, Lord S. "

You now have 3 x Hard-Earned Lesson. Dangerous is increasing... Making Waves is increasing... You've lost a quality: Wounds.*
>>"My dearest Wires, Hopefully your stomach is not too upset after our supper. In case you've had to enlist the help of my close friend Laudanum, I send this pink-painted puss (boots not included) to partially palliate the perilous predicament you might currently be in. For me, I think I'll stay in bed until my head is once again demon-free and I solemnly promise to forego any further culinary experiments involving this wretched lacre. Well, unless I come across a recipe for lacre-glazed doughnuts. Please do tell should you be lucky to find a respectable enough agency offering secretary labour, as I might be inclined to employ one myself to sort through my research papers now that I am back in University's good book. That last trip to Grunting Fen sure took a toll, but I've got enough research notes to start a bonfire whose luminosity would rival that of a certain dawn machine. But, I'm rambling, so please ignore my feverish phantasmagoria. Horrifyingly haunted, Lord S."

> Firstly, your last letter’s illustrative alliteration was illuminative! I do enjoy a good poetic device, so alliterative missives bring joy to my heart!
> 
> Dinner was excellent, no complaints about its digestive qualities. My walk home was unfortunately interrupted by a pair of Constables, whom I suspect were acting on a tip from Feducci, and they promptly collared and packed me off to Newgate. So it goes.
> 
> How amazing it is that you were reinstated to the University, for that was the very reason my own recent trip to our favorite nautical point of scientific interest, Grunting Fen. Was your reception back into the arms of academia a little lackluster, too?  I had hoped to at least find a certain group of Porters and speak to them about all that transpired last semester, as conversations with them are usually Insightful, but could not find them anywhere on the grounds.
> 
> If you continue mending fences, so to speak, I hear restoring your reputation to Court is a more profitable endeavor. Wait, how is your reputation with the Empress these days? Maybe I should not presume you have done anything to damage it. Though, if you were to do so, I would not hold it against you! I mean, you saw the fruits of her bargain with the Masters, did you not?

>>*Stabin Daback has invited you to share a pot of tea at Beatrice's tea shop.*
>>"Dear Sue, A most marvelous monicker, m'lady! I'll be delighted to share a pot of tea at B's with you, and you can tell me all about that dreadful red-tape affair that left you with a name not to your liking. In reply to your last letter, I was indeed disappointed by the lack of flair upon my return to the University. So much so, that I'm planning to postpone my scholarly pursuits until I have cleared my head overseas, as I was offered a governorship of a small colony as a way of making amends for what some considered to be a scandalously sedicious and slanderous opera bordering on attempted regicide, and what others saw as a superbly satirical overview of the sorry state of affairs at HRM's Court. I'm in no hurry, though, as I still feel there are plenty of hearts to break, hands to shake, backs to stab and spleens to grab (metaphorically, of course) in this great, ghastly city of ours. Looking forward to seeing you, Lord S."

> Greetings!
>
> Sorry, I could not respond sooner, though I must say, I’m rather impressed that your runner somehow managed to slip your invitation into my pocket, as I dashed from the Docks to my Laboratory, then slip away with me being completely unawares. Are you certain their previous occupation was not that of a footpad or cutpurse? Or, mayhaps you are, or they were, and find such skills handy, should the occasion arise? Keep your wallet close around that one!
> 
> Anyways, I’ve been in a rush since departing Port Cecil. The Youthful Naturalist and I were conducting certain experiments dependent on the cycles of tides, so you see time was of the essence. Things had been progressing smoothly, but upon reaching the crucial juncture, my ignorance of Monstrous Anatomy thwarted the entire experiment. Stubbornly, I insisted on a second attempt, but it too ended in failure. I conceded that he was right, I had neglected my studies, and pledged to remedy the matter. So began my first trip back to London.
> 
> Back in my Laboratory, I poured over books and poured Warblers into beakers, all to further my Monstrous Anatomy, as high as it would go. If you come across the Naturalist in your voyages, I urge you to increase your knowledge of the subject as well, as much as you can, before you end up in a similar predicament!
> 
> I returned to Port Cecil, and the Naturalist and I finally completed our experiments. Then, he did something desperate and stupid. Sick, and knocking on Death’s, he sent me back to London for help. I think I have found what he needs, so now I prepare to zail for Port Cecil a third time…

But, now I'm back and as eager as always to endulge in the wonderfully extravagant surprises London has to offer. After my return, I noticed that I've been pushed away from the public's eye, and this simply won't do. Therefore I am now embarking on a quest to make some waves around here, and I would like to start with another lacreous supper, to which you are cordially invited. As before, a clear head and an empty stomach are advisable. Looking forward to seeing you, Lord S."

In reply to your last missive, I assure you that I have no intention of sailing North, as I have already freed myself from that particular desire. Although, I see now that my absence and the consequent late reply might have caused unnecessary worry to you, given your experience with the friend who succumbed to the search. For this, I humbly apologize, as I would never cause harm to you (feeding you infernal broths and incendiary hors d'oeuvres notwithstanding). Deliciously yours, Lord S."

Concerned, and naturally curious as to how a person ended up in such a forlorn place, I rushed to their aid. Bending over the lip and peering into the darkness below, I called out… and a voice answered. Not the voice of any man, of that I am certain, but a… hunger. An emptiness. The sound of which sent me into such a spiral that I—

>> "Dear Sue, Thank you for the invitation, as a relaxing cup is just the thing I crave after an intense fortnight of getting my Notability up enough to be able to polish my resume and apply for a position of a Correspondent. You see, after my return to University, I was looking for a quiet place far from the chatter of students to finish my latest poem (d_ably hard to find a rhyme for "Regina" while trying to return to Society's good graces - if you remember, I'm still a pariah when it comes to the stuck-up sycophants at the Shuttered Palace. Had this been a regular Veilgarden commission, a readily available rhyme would have been immediately, if imprudently, used). I will use that most hated, and yet undeniably efficient tool of the tabloid muck-rakers, the clliffhanger, and continue my story in a letter you will be receiving from my valet shortly, along with a symbolic token of my appreciation of our friendship. For the time being, do share your thoughts on my career choice, especially in the light of my attending your Salon, as I am unsure if discarding my mantle of an Author would preclude me from that particular joy. Deliciously yours, Lord S."

>> "Dear Sue, I hope you will find a good use for these shiny trinkets (a word of warning - the rubies don't counteract the Cantigaster venom in wine, no matter what our medieval fathers believed). Back to my story from B's teahouse. In my ramblings through the corridors, I found a filthy four-by-four flat, free from occupants, firing up my near-forgotten fantasy of flinging myself into the fiery field of Correspondence. The cozy room could be cleaned, cleared of clutter and recreated as a veritable laboratory for a respected Correspondent. The cost of such a quest would be drastically curtailed if one requested it from a position of a Correspondence scholar, which is why I am looking to leap into a new career. I've fulfilled all the prerequisites, but I still have qualms about it. Is it too early? Should I reestablish myself at Court first? Any advice or thoughts you might send my way will be greatly appreciated, as you seem to have experienced more of the Neath than I. Deliciously yours, Lord S."

>
>That guiding star led me through to the Forgotten Quarter and you that first set of Stones. It opened the door to the University where even more material awaited. Then, it opened another door to the Court, where I attempted to give voice to the Space Between Stars through symphonies played on glass drums and trapezing xylophonists swinging from the rafters. And it led me across the Unterzee, to islands of such scientific important that it crashed through the closed doors of the University, leaving them no other choice but to reinstate me.

If memory serves, you are well-versed in the ghastly affair of Glasswork, might you know something about these verdant flashes I keep glancing in the corner of my eye from various surfaces? Anyway, I've realized I haven't addressed one of your questions, and I apologize for it. Alas, this was my first Christmas in the Neath, and I was completely unprepared for the multitude of opportunities it presented, one of them being the option to upgrade one's lodgings. I am still in my little room above the bookshop, although I am seriously entertaining the idea of purchasing a lovely piece of real estate in the Bazaar, as I have already amassed the required amount. After all, what better location in which to practise inscribing flaming texts than the Bazaar itself? If anyone has the chance of providing fireproof masonry and furniture, it's the Masters.

That’s right, my Watchfulness exceeded previously known bounds and I have unlocked what some on the Surface refer to as “the End Game.” I am not certain of what the Game is which they speak entails, exactly, nor does it seem especially amusing.

>>  "Dear Sue, What disconcerting news, indeed! War in Parabola? And here I was, obliviously preparing myself for a casual walk through the jungle landscapes I glimpsed through the mirror in my lab for the first time the other day. The scene looked so tranquil that I almost fell through the reflective surface, so potent was its hypnotic pull on me. But, at the last moment, I realized that it might be prudent to dress for the occasion, and pack some additional cucumber sandwiches, firepower and hair cream, as one never knows how long one would be kept on the other side of the shiny silver sea. And now you're telling me I was about to dive headfirst into a warzone... Thank you, dear friend, as I will now postpone my trip to Parabola for a while, to prepare properly. Any additional scrap of information you might fling my way about what provisions might prove useful will be appreciated. In any case, I am in no hurry to leave London yet, as I am in the middle of acquiring a more respectable lodgings, and the paperwork required is proving to be a rather steep, slippery and inhospitable hill to climb. This is in fact the reason behind my exceptionally tardy response to your kind invitation, as the note from you tragically lodged itself between two envelopes stacked with the Bazaar permits required by the estate agency. Begging your forgiveness, I remain deliciously yours, Stabin. "

> Dear Lord Stabbin —

> I would not worry about encountering any hostilities yourself when venturing through the mirror, the War, or at least its outbreak, was entirely my own doing and seems to be localized entirely around my basecamp. Some ancient conflict between the Cats and the Fingerkings, seemingly settled, until I decided to poke the proverbial hornet’s nest. Really, all I was trying to do was route some railway track through Parabola—the scenery is quite lovely, when viewed through the window of a speeding carriage—and ended up treading on the tail of a resting Cat. Or, perhaps it was a Snake? Gah, I am mixing metaphors again! Whatever I poked, or tread upon, or otherwise disturbed—it roused itself and attacked its sworn enemy. I’m just providing the mortars, mounted upon my train‘s baggage cars.

> Finding lodgings that benefit one’s station is such a drag. Remember my larceny of Feducci’s residence? It sounds as if you are going for a place on the Premises of Bazaar? Those are some sweet digs! I know I warned against zailing to Polythreme—‘tis a silly place—but, perhaps you would have better luck acquiring the necessary paperwork there?

>>*At Beatrice's, Stabin Daback shared a pot of Imperial White tea with you, a subtle Khaganian tea with a surprising flavour. You've lost 1 x Free Evening (new total 0). Persuasive has increased to 176 - A Mesmerising Presence! Making Waves has increased to 19! Suspicion has dropped to 1 - Not Entirely Blameless! Subtle has not changed from 11 because it's higher than 4.*
>> "Dear Sue, I have indeed cast my eye upon lovely little leasable lodgings in the Bazaar area, and I am almost done with acquiring the needed permits via frequent visits to Baseborn and Fowlingpiece's office. The fact that they sometimes happen to be present at the premises at the same time, along with their night guards, makes the venture a bit tedious, but I believe that I will have the necessary amount in a few more trips. And the rounds certainly do wonders for my nimbleness, so I am getting much-needed exercise as well. How wonderful to hear that the beligerents are restricting themselves to a small part of Parabola, as I am looking forward to trekking the marvelous jungle soon. Please stay out of harm's way, and do feel free to ask for whatever little help you might need from me. Deliciously yours, Lord Stabin P.S. I've been pretty reluctant to point out an insignificant detail for fear of appearing petty or aloof, and please do not take this as a slight of your penmanship or personality, but it is Stabin, without the implication borne by the double B in the name. Nomen est omen, after all, and I shudder to think what such overtly outrageous nomenclature might rouse in the way of suspicion or unnecessary intrigue, especially in the circles of the players of the Game with whom I have no connection whatsoever, nor am aware of their existence. "

>Lord Stabin —

> A thousand apologies about the mix-up! My secretary—a poor typist and lousy with shorthand, but did brew excellent fungal coffee—has been sacked. As for the Game, I’ve taken measures to butter them up, and have received tokens of assurance that they will overlook this transgression. These I pass along to you. I’m uncertain how well they keep, perhaps refrigeration would help to preserve them?

> How is the Festival of the Rose treating you? I hear that next week, tattoos to mark the occasion become available, if one wishes. I was thinking of getting a Correspondence sigil, myself.

>> *At Beatrice's, Stabin Daback shared a cup of Surface tea with you, alongside crumbly hazelnut biscuits. You've lost 1 x Free Evening (new total 3). Persuasive is increasing... Making Waves has increased to 13! Nightmares has dropped to 1 - Wary! Melancholy has not changed from 7 because it's higher than 4.*
>> "Dear Sue, Please, do not fret about the unfortunate fumble of your former secretary. Good help is hard to come by, and I am still waiting for my valet to return with the crate of Canadian ice from the docks that I've sent him fetch as soon as I received your buttery shipment. For the time being, all of the pieces are safely stashed in the cellar, although I had to go through a few bottles of wine to make room. In fact, I might send you one or two as a small thank you, in the hope that the vintage will be to your liking. One has to marvel at the prodigious amount of resources you must have accrued in order to so nonchalantely send a crateful of gifts of such high value. Please accept my apology since the return gifts will sadly be far less valuable, although they will come from the bottom of my heart. It is a sad thing to fall so far as I have once I came to the Neath. But, I am slowly working my way back, and your help and advice thus far played no small part in my ascent. Deliciously yours, Lord Stabin"


>>*Stabin Daback has sent you a Decanter of Lachrymose Chartreuse – a tart and ascetic gift, that lubricates the vocal cords for diverse vocalisations.*
>>"Dear Sue, I suggest you pair this bottle with a selection of blue cheese, liberally sprinkled with grated dry fungi. Serve at room temperature (unless residing in Hell, in which case, chill to a frosty 25 degrees Celsius). "

>> *Stabin Daback has sent you a Glass of Teeth. Read that how you will.*
>> "Dear Sue, When it comes to this year's festival, I believe I will keep my skin unblemished, unless a particularly bizarre or scandalous tattoo tickles my fancy. I am more interested in this Lady in Lilac that everyone is speaking of, as she seems like intriguing company. Speaking of company, I've also heard rumours of interesting companions being available later on. Seeing how I've already had the good fortune of acquainting myself to an extraordinarily fascinating young member of the Royal family, I am optimistic that my retinue will be further expanded by the end of the month, so this is where the majority of my masquing will go this year. "

>Dear L. Stabin —

>You have Surface ice? Extraordinary! Does it taste of sunlight? On second thought, probably not, as no flavors of Law—do Laws have flavors?—could penetrate this deep underground, at least not without setting everything nearby aflame. That your ice remains frozen is good sign. Air, though, that should not retain any effects from the Judgements. Hmm. 
>
>Such things things are on my mind, as of late. I‘ve reached my Ambition, you see, and need only play one final round of cards to achieve my Hearts Desire. At least, that is what the Masters would have you believe. The game is a poisoned chalice. And yet, if I did win, I could return to the Surface. Somewhere in Canada’s far Northern Territories, most like, but only in the winter, when the sun never reaches the horizon. Those in the Neath can never truly return to the Surface because of the Law, and yet, as a fellow Correspondent, you know there are always ways to circumvent such things. Not that I’m even certain that is what I want. I am off half a mind to tear the whole game down.

> Dear L. Stabin —
> 
> Thank you for the lovely wine! I am enjoying it with a wedge sliced from a wheel of blue cheese procured from a the daughter of a certain Cheesemonger, who sends me one every year to mark a certain anniversary. Honestly, an entire wheel of cheese is a bit much for one person to consume in a year, irregardless of however many luncheons they host. 
> 
> Please do not feel obligated to “match” gifts I send your way. They are gifts, given freely! Well, at least, on my end. See, I have been collecting Favours across all of London and calling them in within the final Coil of the Labyrinth of Tigers. Member of the various factions, Plump Vicars and Remorseless Criminals and such, they answer the call and walk into a literal tigers’s den, and I walk out with marks of Tribute. I’m sure those offered up are fine. At least, I did not hear any screaming on my way out. Yes, absolutely given freely, to very large cats, with sharp teeth and long claws. Those Plump Vicars are just fine.
> 
> Anyways, then it is only a matter of zailing to the Elder Continent and exchanging the Tribute for goods desirable to the Rattus Faber at their Market! Along the way, I enjoy a bit of piracy—you would be amazed at the number of pleasure yachts steaming around the Unterzee, packed with carousing socialites that just allow anybody board to join their party—and maybe stop by Godfall or Grunting Fen too, along the way!

> How has the Festival been treating you? Track down the eponymous Exceptional Rose? Have a scandalous encounter behind the ferris wheel in Mizz Plenty‘s Perfumed Garden, perhaps?
> 
> Listen, can you do me a favour? Wait, let me explain. I’ve just returned from on a hunt in Parabola, bagging Warblers for scientific purposes. As I was traipsing through the undergrowth, I spied movement on the ridgeline and a dark shape slipping between two trees, moving straight towards me. I raised my rifle and fired, but instead of the thump of a feathered body, there came a yowl and something very large crashed away through the brush. I slung my rifle over my shoulder and gave chase to whatever it was I’d shot. The trail led to a rocky overhang—not quite a cave—and there I found my quarry: an enormous, black jungle cat! She had collapsed beneath the overhang, and as I cautiously approached—recognizing the species as a Parabolan Panther—she  breathed her last. I gave a sorry vigil to her final moments, remorseful to have killed such a magnificent beast. And from a dark recess in the crook of that overhang, there came a mewling cry. Then, another. And a third.
> 
> I know London’s no place for an apex Parabolan predator, buy they’re just kittens! I couldn‘t just leave them there! So, I may have taken on more than I can handle by bringing back the whole litter. Would you mind looking after one?

> Overwhelmed,

> PS — Be sure to introduce it to the Lady in Lilac before the festival ends. She won’t keep it.

>> *You have received a letter from Stabin Daback. You now have 1 x Flame-proof Missive.*
>> "Dear Sue, Among the throngs of things I have tripped over while retreating to my Bazaar tenement from yet another night of thrillingly debauched revelry in the scantilly lighted alleyways of love-filled London, the wickerwork basket waiting for me at my doorstep was without doubt the most warmheartedly wonderful one. The soft fluff of fur, the hypnotic purring and the perfectly round pair of peligin eyes peering right into (still) my soul, rending my reason, slashing my senses and mauling my mind. I adore it, dear friend, and I am deeply indebted to you for such a gift. I have yet to name it, as I am waiting for the Muses to visit me, since it is deserving of a momentous moniker. As to your question about my festival experience, please find below a selection of sketches showing some of the activities I have partaken of during this season. I am certain you understand that I am writing this in Correspondence solely to ensure the timely incineration of the missive, thwarting any Ministry of Public Decency inquiry into my actions. Finally, I apologize for the slow replies, as I have been feeling quite poorly lately, making it rather hard for me to put quill to paper. I think it is high time to leave London for a while and move either to coastal areas, or spend a fortnight in a jungle somewhere, to get some fresh air. I do hope all is well with you. Deliciously yours, Lord Stabin"
