> Oh, and I can compose these, too! Picked up some extra on my most recent trip to Grunting Fen, gathering research to be readmitted to the University.

> I wanted to bring to my change of name to your attention. My handle was formerly “talkingwires,” which arose from a misunderstanding about how affairs are conducted here in the Neath. So, no more handles, but “Sue Sussudio.” Or, Sue for short.
> 
> Thanks for sending the Flame-proof Missive! My Scholar of the Correspondence is now 9, putting me within throwing distance of becoming a Correspondent myself!
> 
> I'm sending another Revisionist Missive your way, just because I wanted to, and because I have a surplus of notes now that I’m reinstated at the University.
