title: Finally done with Heart’s Game challenges!

Safest build is KataTox Roots+Both Queens. 5 card deck guarantees you see either Roots or Loins handclear. And Katatox Roots can still solocarry. Or make a comp based on "Gambits and literally anyone who gives them 3 prep". Another very safe one is Knuckles/Ribs/Smith. Use Ribs and Smits (Smiths can handle the PP needed, Ribs can help out if needed) until about 4-5 Tolerance, then sweep with Knuckles. For added fun, if you have the stats for it, use Flames instead of Ribs and Briars instead of Smiths. That can actually semi reliable get you to Prog 9! and I've even seen that combo hit Prog 10 once. For the memes.

As for distinctions... Lemme copy paste my mini guide.

**Pages:** get Gambits or KT Roots and literally anyone who can make 2/3 total Prep. (And isnt a Knight or King obv). If you don't see Gambits and either don't see Roots or don't have KT, you can try Paper+Teeth/Investions or Lures with a similar setup. Lures can be very good if he can keep eating Prep, Paper is solid, Teeth/Inversions can get you an early lead before Tolerance, then you can use their Prep options (though Inversions is SA so unless you decide to dress for that, he'll be a total dead draw instead of just a bad one like Teeth after Tolerance. So Inversions is hard to recomend, but he can work with the right gameplan.)

**Team I used for Pages**: Gambits/Cod/Magpies. Magpies was selected only because I got 2 Knights and a King next to them on the third pick, so they had to be picked for the run to qualify. Shadowy gear, Gambits soloes. Magpies was a liability, more a hinderance than accomplice, because they made Counterplay and flooded my hand, but Gambits carried anyway.

**Knights:** get an Advanced stat Knight (or use Nobility and get more than one), or Ribs+Smiths. Flames is actually very, very good for Knights because you don't have heavy hitters (aside from possibly Ribs), and Knights can get outscaled by Tolerance. (Less important if you can get Ribs+Smiths, then Ribs can act like a "King")

**Team I used for Knights**: Disintegrities/Audacities/Flames. With Flames keeping Tolerance at near 0, Disintegrities (with 17 SA) could carry no problem. Audacities made prep or progress when needed. SA gear (with Presuasive in slots I could get away with not using a SA item)

**Kings:** get at least 2 of the 3 Kings ones that can make Prep (all can aside from Knuckles and Roses), get a carry (I did Tallow for the lols but Knuckles is probably best). Briars is good for support because DoublePrep (and we don't have access to Skin) and the extra CP helps a bit. Queen of Cod is great, also reliable DoublePrep, especially if you go Shadowy with Spines.

**Team I used for Kings**: Spines/Tallow/Knuckles. This was was me memeing. I did this before the change to class Distinctions, so no Queens or the Fool or Priests aside from Briars was allowed for the run to even qualify. Normally you build Dangerous with this team and use Tallow and Spines to make Prep. I decided to yolo go KT, have Knuckles get a few hits in at ~80%, then finish with Tallow and 17 KT. Building full Dangerous and just beating them with Knuckles is a better idea, but I wanted to be cheeky.

The Fool and the Queens are good with any of the class specific challenges, though Cod's DoublePrep won't be super useful outside of Kings, her 5 card deck will, and while the Fool needs Persuasive, he/it can benefit from all Priest buffs and can either make prep or off carry (or both). Loins can make prep or fix your hand.

**Motley**, plently of weird and wonderful ways to do it, I decided to go all in on Kings. My plan was to get every single non-advanced stat King, Briars, Audacities, Knight of Skin, and both Queens. Make prep, then nuke. Almost managed, I didn't get Cod, so I had to get Flames instead, would have gotten Gambits or Paper or Ribs if I could have, but draft#9 was beyond cursed for Flames to be the pick while my whole strategy is a few big swings, so Tolerance barely mattered. Still worked, easy 7-0. Full Persuasive gear outside of Übergoat. But there are plenty of other cool ways to do it, Smiths+Knights and Knuckles can work, 5 Aces+Ambivalences can be a 26 CP (all 5 Aces means Ace of Kings) tactical nuke, etc.

**Team I used for Motley**: As stated above, Skin/Flames/Loins/Briars/Audacities/Spines/Knuckles/Roses/Motley. Persuasive Gear+Übergoat(not necessary)

**Embalmers**: Literally just make a good team, I'd advise against using Advanced stats, unless you are like a Nemesis-complete Licentiate and have enough KT to get to 19. I could only go that high on an advanced stat if we had Red Science accomplices. Highway stat accomplices will suddenly not be near-auto successes, probably not even Skin's basic move unless you are dressed with at least some Watchful focus so be prepared to burn Second Chances/use a Mood/Vote yourself a relevant advanced stat from the House of Chimes if that makes you able to break 100% (Remember, Ambivalances gives +2 SA on his own, and Cod gives +1 KT and +1 SA, so it is possible to get lucky and still go with an advanced stat based comp, just way harder)

**I honestly don't remember the exact team I used for Embalers**. I think it was just Skin+Spines+some filler. Shadowy gear for Spines to actually connect.

The Disctinctions Guide is somewhat out of date as it was written before the last balance pass, but still holds up, just more RNG to draft what you want.
