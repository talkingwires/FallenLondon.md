There are sigils across the top of the stone, labelling it.

"Something which originated in the core of one's being and has long been far from the surface." This could mean a gift from the heart, or flesh cut from one's own organs, or a secret long unrevealed.

"Substance shared with a distant sibling." The pale surface of the stone is mottled and silver as the face of the moon.

"The memory of a purpose assigned." What recollection is locked in the stone, the Correspondence does not say.

"A peaceful but undeniable demand." The Creditor does not threaten, but it insists on its rights. The sigils used here are the same used for gravity.
