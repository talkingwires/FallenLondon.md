>> One of the social actions you can take in Attend to Matters of Shadows and Suspicion is to invite another player to a spot of suspicious loitering. As an action, you can invite a contact (giving you a hastily scrawled warning note), wait for them to respond (giving them one), then do something with the resulting information, with one of the options being giving you and your friend two warning notes each.
>> 
>> If you have an alt or a friend willing to play along, and you alternate who invites and who responds, each of you can get 2 warning notes per action. Not only is this better than the vast majority of other second chance sources, but you can cash in five of each for an average of 25 Shadowy CP giving an average of 7.14 Shadowy CP per action, including the actions needed to cash in, which is even better than levelling with a Woesel. (It is, unfortunately, a bit unreliable because of the amount of CP gained from Warning Notes is random). Plus, basically anyone can do it, regardless of character advancement.

>You actually get three Second chances per action on your main! To do this, make sure your alt chooses "[learn Shadowy lessons from your surveillance](https://fallenlondon.wiki/wiki/Learn_Shadowy_lessons_from_your_surveillance)". This way, your main first gets one Hastily Scrawled Note for accepting, and then two more when the alt picks the finishing action. Plus, both of the accounts gain some Shadowy CP.

>This is especially useful when converting Echoes to Scrip doing Birds of Brass&Bone according to the Mammoth Ranching guide -- that's a \~25% check you'll be taking A LOT. For example, I've done 55 Birds this week and still had some time left.
