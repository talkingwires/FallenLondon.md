You've got the [[Associating with Radical Academics|Court of the Wakeful Eye]]  unlocked. After you go there and get access to one of their Ambassadors, you can keep supplying tribute to the Labyrinth of Tigers.

The 6.49 EPA tribute is done exclusively with Favours. You can exchange 7 Favours from Society, Criminals, Church, Bohemians, or Docks, for 23 [[Tribute]]. To get that EPA it has to be card based tribute, so you just wait on opportunity cards for the Favours and deposit them any time you hit 7. There's a cap of 263 tribute this way, and most of the time you'll be considerably under that. When you're at the cap (or sometimes when you're at the cap and have other favours that you can't deposit), you sail back to the Court of the Wakeful Eye. It takes 4 actions there to turn 20 tribute into a [[Night-Whisper]]. That bit will take a good chunk of a day. That's effectively one tribute run.

If you haven't gotten to far into the endgame, you then just sail back to London. But if you've got access to Khan's Heart, then often you'll sail there instead, bringing along a skeleton to sell to the [[Sell the Diplomat a skeleton|Trifling Diplomat]] to buy [[Crackling Device|Crackling Devices]] for when they are saleable in the Rat Market, use up their weekly quota of emetic Revelations on The Pulling of a Thread. After that you could either plow directly back to London through the Snares (highly dangerous), head through the Pillared Sea hoping for Becalmed to jump back to London (damages your stats) or sail the long way back along the current, stopping at [[Port Cecil]] for [[Segmented Ribcage|Segmented Ribcages]] and other assorted goods.
