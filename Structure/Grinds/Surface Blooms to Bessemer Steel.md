Usually I source [[Bessemer Steel Ingot|Bessemer Steel]] by stealing it in Parabola for 15 Identities per 100 Steel. However, I currently need a lot of Blackmail material right now which I get by upconverting Identities.

Right now I am trying to figure out if selling Fillips of Effervescence from Station VIII is actually somewhat profitable or if I should stick to the bonezone.

Selling 1 Fillip gets me 5 [[Knob of Scintillack|Knobs if Scintillack]] for 4 Actions + 1 [[Extraordinary Implication]]. If I do it 8 times I get 40 Knobs. 40 Knobs can get me 10 Snuff in my lab (8 Knobs per 2 Snuffs) which in turn give me 65 [[Preserved Surface Blooms]] by using the Minor Smuggling Card. This also takes into account that your lab uses up 5 Blooms in total.

The math should look like this: - 8x Steal Fillip from Station VIII ( 24 Actions) - 8x Sell Fillip = 40 Knobs (8 Actions) - 5x make supplies in lab = 10 Snuff (5 Actions) - 10x Trade Snuff for Blooms = 65 Blooms (10 Actions ) - 10x Manage Banditry (10 Actions) - 2,71x Trade 24 Blooms for Steel = 352,3 Steel (2,71 Actions)

To sum it up:
- Total Actions: 59,71
- Bloom per Actions: 1,08 BpA
- Steel per Action: 5,90 SpA
- Steel per Bloom; 5,42 SpB

Steel per Action by using Identities: 5,26 SpA (I assumed 4 Actions while searching + 15 for the Identities) You also need a Trip to Parabola where you cannot draw cards and it costs 2 Echos.

Using Fillips seems to be slightly better than the Parabola route but if you want to chill in the Hinterlands this could be useful. This grind also dies mit cost you any Echos as long as you have enough Extraordinary Implications. The cost for those is covered by the Rostygold you get for reducing Banditry by protecting the old man.

Could someone tell me the Steel per Action you can get by using the Bonezone? I usually do a Mammoth Ribcage + Brass Skull which should be around 6,57 SpA if you have a 4,00 EpA grind available to get the Skull and you can produce a ribcage in your lab in around 15 actions.
