1. Start with Stoking the Stove 1 and 7 Darkness (this is the state immediately after bringing the stove back to the station).
2. Add more plaques to the stove 9 times (this drops Darkness to 1 + 0 CP and raises Stoking the Stove to 4 + 0 CP). This costs 9 actions and 63 Correspondence Plaques.
3. Hold your breath underwater (this gets you a variable amount of Final Breaths - the average seems to be 29). This costs 1 action and gains ~29 Final Breaths. (Note: in general, holding your breath underwater seems to get you ~(33 - 4*Darkness) Final Breaths)
4. Add more plaques to the stove again (drops Darkness to 0, raises Stoking the Stove to 4 + 1 CP). This costs 1 action and 7 Plaques.
5. Perform the following loop 8 times:
	1. Hold your breath underwater twice. The first time gets you ~33 Final Breaths (0 Darkness), the second gets you ~29. This costs 2 actions and gains ~62 Final Breaths (it also raises Darkness to 2 + 1 CP)
	2. Add more plaques to the stove (drops Darkness to 1 + 0 CP, raises Stoking the Stove by 1 CP). This costs 1 action and 7 Plaques.
	3. Hold your breath underwater (raises Darkness to 2 + 0 CP). This costs 1 action and gains ~29 Breaths.
	4. Add more plaques to the stove (drops Darkness to 0, raises Stoking the Stove by 1 CP). This costs 1 action and 7 Plaques.
6. Each iteration of the loop costs 5 actions and 14 Plaques, raises Stoking the Stove by 2 CP, and gains ~91 Breaths. So, performing 8 iterations costs 40 actions and 112 Plaques, raises Stoking the Stove to 6 + 6 CP and gains ~728 Breaths.
7. Hold your breath underwater twice, then add more plaques to the stove (same as in steps 5.1 and 5.2 - costs 3 actions and 7 Plaques, sets Darkness to 1 + 0 CP and Stoking the Stove to 7, gets ~62 Final Breaths)
8. Hold your breath underwater 10 times.
	1. The first time gives ~29 Final Breaths (1 Darkness)
	2. The second and third give ~25 Breaths (2 Darkness)
	3. The fourth and fifth give ~21 Breaths (3 Darkness)
	4. The sixth and seventh give ~17 Breaths (4 Darkness)
	5. The eighth to tenth give ~13 Breaths (5 Darkness)
9. In total, this costs 10 actions and gains ~181 Breaths.
10. Add more plaques to the stove. Since we now have Stoking the Stove 7, this sets Darkness to 7 and Stoking the Stove to 8. It also gives 2 CP of Scandal (and some Tracklayers' Displeasure which I will ignore for now since it doesn't really matter). This costs 1 action and 7 Plaques.
11. Now we have to hunt the stove down. This is technically card-dependent, but it's a 10x frequency card in a smaller deck so you shouldn't have much trouble. If you succeed all the checks (this assumption will be revisited later), this costs 4 actions and gets you 5E worth of bats. Now we are back where we started, with 7 Darkness and Stoking the Stove 1.

In total this has cost 69 actions and 196 Plaques, and we have gained 1000 Final Breaths (which are worth 508E when we convert via Tinned Ham) and 5E. This gives a naive EPA of 6.014 (valuing each plaque as a 0.5E cost).

After taking into account the difficulty of getting Plaques (28.98 actions to get 196), we get 5.236 EPA.

With 317 Dangerous, our final action cost (after taking Plaques, failures and menaces into account) is 101.03, for an EPA of 5.08.

With 288 Dangerous, we need to recalculate the cost of failures when holding our breath. We now only need 37 successes (instead of 39), so we expect 4.111 failures (and 8.222 CP of Wounds). The expected number of actions spent on menace reduction is now 3.163, and the final action cost is 107.17, for an EPA of 4.79

It's slightly worse than what I originally worked out, but not by too much.
