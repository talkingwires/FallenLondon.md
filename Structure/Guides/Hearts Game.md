 > the absolute best team to get the Pages distinction with is probably Gambits, Cod, and Loins.
 
 
 ---

> Managed the last of my distinction runs last night. General notes:
> 
> RNG on drafting is incredibly high, and if you're going for distinctions, it's generally better to just slap on a woesel (to fail checks for faster evasiveness gain), fail a round, and then redraft, than it is to try and keep a "weak" team going. You'll burn less actions redrafting (imo) than playing out a team that can only win 50-ish% of rounds and trying for luck.
> 
> Pages are currently terrible, and (aside from Gambits or going for the pages distinction) should probably never be drafted. This goes double for the Priest of Magpies, the only Priest who has no +prep, and is stuck giving a weak buff to bad cards.
> 
> Unless you literally have no other choice, or it will specifically win you the round, it's currently almost never a good idea to play checkless progress options. Counterplay seemingly exists to *heavily* punish trying to avoid checks (insert my rant that Counterplay seems like it was designed to counter season 1 Roots/Teeth/Loins and not for the current state of the game here).
> 
> It's *generally* better to draft main stat accomplices over advanced stat ones of the same tier. I've found that the advanced stat requirements are too high for the generally "meh" to "terrible" performances. This is most visible with the "Knight of Talons", who ties for requiring the most prep of any Knight, gives the least progress of any Knight for the same prep reqs, and requires investing 17 KT to get 100% on checks.
> 
> Accomplices that give 2 prep at a time are incredibly valuable - that's Knight of Skin and Queen of Cod. Effectively saves you an entire turn every time you play a 2 prep card instead of a 1 prep card.
> 
> Second Chances can massively reduce variance, and considering failures now triple-dip on threat (giving tolerance and evasiveness, wasting a turn on the failure when each turn spent accelerates tolerance and evasiveness gain, and giving counterplay which *also* gives more tolerance and evasiveness), it's worth investing the second chances in "high impact" situations.
 > 
> Distinction specific notes:
> 
> Kings is *very* easy, as long as draft RNG lets you actually pick kings. Knuckles or Roses and a prep source will handle this with no problem, and Spines can do the work if you didn't get those options. As seems to usually be the case, Ambivalences and Tallow seem to be the weaker options and require more investment, but if you have the setup they'll clear this as well. King cards make enough progress baseline that Briars is probably not much value here, but it doesn't hurt you either. Winning run was 7 for 7 first try, didn't see much challenge here.
> 
> Knights is a bit more RNG reliant than Kings, but generally still pretty open as long as drafting plays nice. Ribs clears this *easily*, and you have Skin, Flames, Cod, and Smiths as great support options here. Generally seems like you just want to avoid the advanced stat options on this one, as Talons is terrible, Disintegrities is solid but requires a bit of a niche stat, and Nobility requires some *extreme* RNG in drafting. Winning run was 7 for 8 second try, first try took Talons and reminded me why I hate Talons (and was abandoned after round 2), second run lost 1 round to bad luck with poison tolerance RNG (though I believe I misplayed a bit while tired as well).
> 
> Motley was one I found to be both easy and fun. You're basically just looking for as many "good stuff" accomplices as you can get, eg Cod, Loins, Knuckles, Ribs, Skin, Gambits, Spines, and Roses. You *generally* want to avoid advanced stat accomplices, and just aim for 70-80% success on all the mainstats. Goal is to build prep as fast as possible, and then cycle your hand as much as possible to play any cards that give a lot of progress. Cod, Loins, and Briars are great here for their ability to cycle your hand. You'll be drafting so many accomplices that you're probably going to see almost all the good options offered to you at some point, you just need to avoid adding actively bad (AKA any Pages that aren't Gambits) cards to your deck. Winning run was 7 for 7 first try, again not much of a challenge.
> 
> Pages is one of the two where RNG on drafting is going to be *extreme* make-or-break. I did this with Gambits and Smiths - the other Page I took is literally irrelevant, it only got played when I was not allowed to play Gambits 2 prep options or a prep gaining option. Counterplay will absolutely ruin your day on this if you have to play checkless options, you need a prep source and then ideally want to just play Gambits as many times as possible. Cod is great here, Loins works, and Briars and Smiths will work too. I'll mention again the Priest of Magpies *does not* have a prep source, and is probably an active hindrance here to be avoided. I personally feel that if you didn't get Gambits and good setup for a Pages attempt, you probably just want to woesel and redraft. Winning run was 7 for 9 second try, first try attempted checkless Roots and Teeth and got stomped by counterplay, took a few redrafts to get Gambits and a valid prep card, lost 2 rounds to Gambits doing Gambits things (including an instant fail) and won 7 due to Gambits still being amazing for progress.
> 
> Embalming is the second distinction where I'd say drafting RNG is "make-or-break" beyond just "are you allowed to pick a card of the right type", though it can be mitigated. It generally demands a high-consistency team that doesn't play any checkless progress options. Cod (unsurprisingly) helps massively here due to getting you down to a 5 card deck. Outside of that, it's a normal Hearts' Game round with harder checks - if you've avoided advanced stat accomplices, have a good prep source and a good King to get progress, you can just spend a bunch of second chances here to massively buff your success chances and make this much easier. Winning run was 7 for 9 on second try, cant remember what I took first but it was hard enough that I redrafted a few times to get a more consistent team. I probably burned around 25 second chances on this to get it done "safely" and not have to take multiple extra tries.

> Motley: My basic teambuilding strategy was "accomplices that generate prep and kings to use it."
> 
> Embalming: Knuckles + skin + teeth. Not the greatest team ever but it did the job. You can still 75% skin's checks with no watchful gear.
> 
> Knights: Flames! Ribs is also pretty good. I used flames + smiths + nobility. It worked, eventually, but do yourself a favor and try to get something better than Nobility.
> 
> Pages: This one is harder. After a few failed teams, I'm currently using lures + smiths + cod. I'm 5/0 so far and it seems to work very well.
> 
> Kings: This one is easy, there are a lot of good kings. I used smiths + ambivalences + knuckles, which was aggressively mediocre but got the job done. If you desperately need a prep source, motley or ambivalences are slow but provide it very reliably.

> I won the Embalming trophy with Shadowy build: Cod,Livers and Gambits. First get Cod's Ace of Queens for Shadowy boost,then play Livers twice for 2 preparations. After that play Gambit's second option on both his cards. With a bit of luck you can win 2-3 rounds for 20 actions. You can also win Page trophy with this strategy using any of the Priests instead of Livers.

> **Pages:** get Gambits or KT Roots and literally anyone who can make 2 Prep. (And isnt a Knight or King obv). If you don't see Gambits and either don't see Roots or don't have KT, you can try Paper+Teeth/Investions or Lures with a similar setup. Lures can be very good if he can keep eating Prep, Paper is solid, Teeth/Inversions can get you an early lead before Tolerance, then you can use their Prep options (though Inversions is SA)
> 
> **Team I used for Pages**: Gambits/Cod/Magpies. Magpies was selected only because I got 2 Knight and a King next to them on the third pick, so they had to be picked for the run to qualify. Shadowy gear, Gambits soloes. Magpies was a liability because they made Counterplay and flooded my hand, but Gambits carried anyway.
> 
> **Knights:** get an Advanced stat Knight (or use Nobility and get more than one), or Ribs+Smiths. Flames is actually very, very good for Knights because you don't have heavy hitters, and Knights can get outscaled by Tolerance. (Less important if you can get Ribs+Smiths, then Ribs can act like a "King")
> 
> **Team I used for Knights**: Disintegrities/Audacities/Flames. With Flames keeping Tolerance at near 0, Disintegrities (with 17 SA) could carry no problem. Audacities made prep or progress when needed. SA gear (with Presuasive in slots I could get away with not using a SA item)
> 
> **Kings:** get at least 2 of the 3 Kings ones that can make Prep (all can aside from Knuckles and Roses), get a carry (I did Tallow for the lols but Knuckles is probably best). Briars is good for support because DoublePrep (and we don't have access to Skin) and the extra CP helps a bit. Queen of Cod is great, also reliable DoublePrep, especially if you go Shadowy with Spines.
> 
> **Team I used for Kings**: Spines/Tallow/Knuckles. This was was me memeing. I did this before the change to class Distinctions, normally you build Dangerous with this team and use Tallow and Spines to make Prep. I decided to yolo go KT, have Knuckles get a few hits in at \~80%, then finish with Tallow and 17 KT. Building full Dangerous and just beating them with Knuckles is a better idea, but I wanted to be cheeky.
> 
> The Fool and the Queens are good with any of the class specific challenges, though Cod's DoublePrep won't be super useful outside of Kings, her 5 card deck will, and while the Fool needs Persuasive, he/it can benefit from all Priest buffs and can either make prep or off carry (or both). Loins can make prep or fix your hand.
> 
> **Motley**, plently of weird and wonderful ways to do it, I decided to go all in on Kings. My plan was to get every single non-advanced stat King, Briars, Audacities, Knight of Skin, and both Queens. Make prep, then nuke. Almost managed, I didn't get Cod, so I had to get Flames instead, would have gotten Gambits or Paper or Ribs if I could have, but draft#9 was beyond cursed for Flames to be the pick while my whole strategy is a few big swings, so Tolerance barely mattered. Still worked, easy 7-0. Full Persuasive gear outside of Übergoat. But there are plenty of other cool ways to do it, Smiths+Knights and Knuckles can work, 5 Aces+Ambivalences can be a 26 CP (all 5 Aces means Ace of Kings) tactical nuke, etc.
> 
> **Team I used for Motley**: As stated above, Skin/Flames/Loins/Briars/Audacities/Spines/Knuckles/Roses/Motley. Persuasive Gear+Übergoat(not necessary)
> 
> **Embalmers**: Literally just make a good team, I'd advise against using Advanced stats, unless you are like a Nemesis-complete Licentiate and have enough KT to get to 19. I could only go that high on an advanced stat if we had Red Science accomplices. Highway stat accomplices will suddenly not be near-auto successes, probably not even Skin's basic move unless you are dressed with at least some Watchful focus so be prepared to burn Second Chances/use a Mood/Vote yourself a relevant advanced stat from the House of Chimes if that makes you able to break 100% (Remember, Ambivalances gives +2 SA on his own, and Cod gives +1 KT and +1 SA, so it is possible to get lucky and still go with an advanced stat based comp, just way harder)
> 
> I honestly don't remember the exact team I used for Embalers. I think it was just Skin+Spines+some filler. Shadowy gear for Spines to actually connect.

> If at all possible, it's a valid strategy to focus on one main attribute for your party, e.g. Flames and Skin work together incredibly well not only because they are both very powerful accomplices, but they also synergise well because they both want a high Watchful stat.
> Also this was mentioned before by someone else here, but of course going for accomplices who want basic attributes is advisable, because in a pinch, a second chance can save your run.
> 
> It's probably also worth mentioning that because of the luck aspect, you shouldn't expect to get a fully synergising party every time, and that isn't necessary in order for your party to win, either. Two accomplices that pair well are plenty. As for what cards pair well, finding out is part of the fun of the game, but to get the two distinctions you are looking for, these may prove worthwhile: 
> 
> ## Pages 
> 
> Gambits was also mentioned here before, but just to reiterate, they are an absolute powerhouse. I have never lost a single run with them. They pair well with both queens (Loins for clearing your hand, Cod for a smaller deck). Briars, Smiths, and Audacities also work well enough for this challenge, as they all should guarantee that Gambits is ready by the third action. I'll note that Briars is especially useful because it also allows you to clear your hand, though only on a success. If you have Gambits and any of these, the third accomplice is almost inconsequential.
> 
> Teeth and Roots. The Dynamic Duo. They go back all the way to the first season, and I have won an all pages round using the two of them in every single season since. Counterplay affected them harshly, but they still work well enough together. Probably for the best if you can also get your hand on any of the accomplices I recommended for Gambits as a third team member, because without preparations, Tooth will be of little use for two thirds of the game. Also, should you be able to muster up a lot of Kataleptic Toxicology, even better, because Roots' advanced options are pretty good.
> 
> ## Knights
> 
> Flames. He's just that good. Much like Roots once did, he simply bypasses one of the game's main aspects. Four of Fumes especially can carry an entire round by constantly resetting Tolerance, while still making Progress.
> You'll still likely want a more substantial source of Progress, so Ribs is an ideal accomplice to him, followed closely by Audacities. Failing that, Livers and Skin are less ideal but still valid choices (prepare for a drawn out round if you truly can't get any better "heavy hitter" than these two). Also of course, Smiths is a very good fit for any knight party, making them hit harder, plus it makes Flames' skill checks easier.
> 
> Ribs. Ribs is a heavy hitter you want to get ready as soon as possible, so you'll want Skin to make her get there faster. And even if you can't get Skin, you'll probably be fine if you can get a reliable source of Preparations elsewhere- Smiths would be ideal, pulling double duty supporting her firepower and setting her up well, but either Queen, Audacities, and Livers also are worthwhile options. Also each of those pairs well with Ribs even if you have Skin already. 
> 
> Nobilities is powerful - with the caveat that you need a good Glasswork outfit to make her work. And of course, Talons and/or Integrities. A very rigid but simple strategy: ramp up the necessary Preparations and then use the advanced Glasswork options on any of the cards in your hands, if you have Nobilities and at least one of the other two you will always have at least one available to you at any point in time. Skin also pairs well with Nobilities, and really any accomplice that has a useful option requiring four or more Preparations, because they can ramp it up so fast.
> 
> Also, once again, Smiths is a good option to go with too.
> 
> Because of the high reliance on Nobilities, I can only really recommend going for this strategy if you draw her as your first accomplice, otherwise you're likely to get stuck with Talons or Integrities who don't synergise terribly well with most other accomplices, especially not each other.
> 
> Apart from that - general strategies while playing: 

> ## Card Draw 
> 
> With Counterplay being a thing, thinking about when you draw new cards from your deck has become an even more critical part of every game, and it already was before.
> 
> Let's suppose your team is centered around one accomplice (say, Gambits); you probably do not want to draw any new cards while you still have a card of theirs in your hand you are able to play. Plan around drawing to maximise the chances of getting exactly the cards you want/need. You want to play your best cards over and over again, that usually is the most efficient strategy in this game, so play all of them first and then draw again.
> Also if you have amassed Counterplay, each draw signifies a chance to be hit with a semi-random disadvantage or even a permanent debuff for the remainder of your run. Keep that in mind especially when you are close to winning or losing, because it can decide the outcome of the run.
> 
> Say you are a few points of Progress away from winning the round, but you have some counterplay, and Elusiveness is high as well - maybe check if your remaining cards can't get you there, because drawing now could give your target the chance to escape without any option for you to stop them. Or even if it just means playing a card before an auto-play Tolerance increase makes it less effective. It can make a surprising amount of difference, and I'm pretty sure it's the only way to make a 100% pages run work at the moment.
> 
> ## Sequencing
> 
> Similar to Card Draw in nature, or rather, the latter is just a part of the former: keep in mind when you do what, and why. With every play, there is an increasing chance to raise one of your target's stats, so keep that risk in mind. For example, Teeth's basic options are made to be played as soon as possible, because Tolerance renders them near useless. At the same time, they raise Counterplay, which in turn can turn into a very early Tolerance increase once you draw, which will impede the rest of your game, unless you have a way to circumvent it. So is it worth the risk to play that option now? Can you make up for the potential consequences? Do you maybe want to play yet another card before you draw on the off-chance the worst happens? And so on, and so on.
> 
> It's basic stuff, but can be very important.
> 
> And last but not least: 
> 
> ## Have Fun
> 
> To me at the very least, it is fun to crunch the numbers, compare possible outcomes, gauge probabilities, and all the like. Even then, trying to play 100% accurate at all times likely is just a fast way to burnout. Especially in a game that rewards you with (mechanically) the same amount of rewards whether you win or lose. So trying out strange combinations of accomplices, discovering weird synergies, meeting unexpected outcomes, and of course getting better acquainted with some of the accomplices you otherwise probably wouldn't pick because there usually is a better replacement for them all can be tremendous amounts of fun.
> 
> Has Teeth become a way less useful accomplice over time? Absolutely! Do I still enjoy finding ways to include him in teams or even create a support build to make him the star of the show? Wholeheartedly.
> 
> And there's so much more. Exploring possible uses for weird mechanics like Magpies recycling his own Ace. Figuring out how to counteract Counterplay to make all-Pages work. Chancing on a Counterplay to increase Elusiveness rather than Tolerance or anything else before playing Knuckles' cards. Putting together the largest possible team to try and get from 0 to 8 Progress with a single activation of Motley. There are a lot of things this game allows you to do that have a way larger chance of failing than succeeding, but that just makes it all the more satisfactory if it actually does work.
> 
> To put it in the words of another favourite accomplice of mine: "Suboptimal. But very much not boring."

> For Knights, 2 main ways of doing it is either using Ribs as a surrogate King, or relying on either the Fool of Audacities, or one (or more) of the Advanced Stat Knights to progress. For the second one, I would recomend involving Flames. Even though Flames, in normal play, is agressively mediocre, you won't have real heavy hitters to punch through Tolerance (unless you build around Ribs, Smiths is actually good if you can get him with Ribs, full dangerous kit and you're golden). The Fool/Knights aside from Ribs can get outscaled by Tolerance and reduced to doing only 1CP of Prog at a time, Flames shines in a Knight team.
> 
> For Pages: KTRoots or Gambits is who you want to rely on. Someone to get them 2-3 prep (one of the Queens, Fool, one of the NON Magpies Priest). If you don't have 17 KT, try and fish for Gambits. Technically you can make it work with a comp like Paper/Teeth/Someone to get Prep, or Teeth/ChecklessRoots/Flex, but ideally, you want either KT-Roots or Gambits to be your carry. You only want one accomlice that gives prep, you will only ever need 2-3, (unless you plan to use Lures as a third). And yeah, a third can be anyone, who won't disqualify you. I had Magpies, who was absolutely awful, but I had Gambits/Cod and 3rd was Magpies, 2 Knights and a King, so I didn't have a choice. Still almost managed to sabotage a few rounds with Counterplay. Don't pick Magpies (unless anyone else would disqualify you from the distincion). If you got a carry (KTRoots/Gambits), someone to get prep (a Queen or the Fool or Smits or Briars), the third pick can be a second Page, any of them can work, though I'd recomend against Invesions, if you are using KT Roots beacause in your KT gear, you won't have the SA to make him a non-dead draw. The others can all work. Teeth for early prog, Papers is all around okay, Lures can even be good if you have prep to feed him, the other Queen for consistency or the Fool for a versatile off carry are all decent-great options. Hell, even if you are kitted out in KT gear for Roots, you can still grab Gambits (I wouldn't do the opposite, checkless Roots can be dangerous with the wrong draw order, unless you have Loins)

> If you don’t have 230 base stats + most of best in slot gear it’s probably too early for comfortable play and consistent win streaks. With advanced stats (skills, MAGCATS) situation is even worse, since they require significant fate or time investment.
> 
> If you are desperate to get this season distinction / trophy stick to good base stat composition and use second chances. Good examples would be:
> King of Knuckels + anything that adds preparation without checks
> Spines + Cod + anything that adds preparation without checks
> Skin + Lures + Flames
