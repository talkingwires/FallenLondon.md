## Actions that change your Airs


## Notable Ranges of Airs

* 96-100:  [[Confide in the Chandleress]] : On the  Follow a chandler to her workshop option in  The Department of Menace Eradication storylet: Gives 1 Dock Favor for 3 actions.


Have you ever wanted to cycle Airs, but can’t decide how to or don’t want to use Unfinished Business? I’ve made a guide for those who want to utilize Airs of London the best they can. There’s a lot here, so I would recommend looking for where your current Airs are and going from there. I put mostly storylets in this guide, but there might be a card or two. I also decided not to include some that give out less items or CP than some other options. I put the possible options in order from how they appear, but used the names so locked options don’t confuse people.
