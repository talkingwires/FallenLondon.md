I took the liberty of crunching the numbers on a possible operation:

Initial step: 2 x The Cedar-Woods + The Octagonal Tomb (15 Actions)
	+ 2 x Bright Brass Skull; + 11 x Extraordinary Implication; + 5 x Verse of Counter-Creed; + 1 x Night-Whisper; + 3.5 x Tale of Terror!!; + 12 x Final Breath; + 2 x Human Ribcage.
	- 225 E (Esteem of the Guild)

Sourcing bones: (25.44 Actions)
	Assemble your conclusions, in the Lab. (15.44 Actions)
		Survey of the Neath's Bones -> Palaeontological Discovery -> An amalgamous interment
		+ 4 x Knotted Humerus
	2 x A Composed Composer (2 x 5 Actions)
		- 4 x Favours: Bohemians
		+ 2 x Holy Relic of the Thigh of Saint Fiacre

2 x Skeleton building: Late-game Rubbery Saint (2 x 7 Actions)
	- 1 x Human Ribcage
	- 1 x Bright Brass Skulls
	- 2 x Knotted Humerus
	- 2 x Holy Relic of the Thigh of Saint Fiacre
	Declare your (Skeleton Type) a completed Humanoid.
	+ 217 x Nightsoil of the Bazaar

Liquidate all resources:
	+ 97.75 E (Extraordinary Implications / Tale of Terror!! / Final Breath / Verse of Counter-Creed)
	- 1 x Night-Whisper (1 Action)
	+ 80 E
	- 434 x Nightsoil of the Bazaar (43.4 Actions)
	+ 911.4 x Hand-picked Peppercaps
	+ 455.7 E (Hand-picked Peppercaps)

Total:

408.45 Echoes / 98.84 Actions = 4.13 EpA

Granted, this is without Tinned Ham or Submerged Rector augmentation, but it does, I would say, show one of the possible recipes integrated.
