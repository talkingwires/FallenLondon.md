"I began to look at the Bazaar's accounts," she says. "I knew there must be a record of its older dealings."

The Commissioner tells how she searched for the stele that originally recorded this transaction; how she discovered it had been stolen by the Circumcellion Brotherhood, under the mistaken impression that it was a holy text, and then sunk into the Unterzee near Gaider's Mourn; how she made a pact with a Lady in Black to retrieve this stele; how she then took a steamer to Polythreme to find someone who could translate the text.

There are so many extraordinary incidents to this tale that it takes almost half an hour in the telling, but no one at the table interrupts. Even the Board Secretary puts down his pen and listens with his chin in his hand.
