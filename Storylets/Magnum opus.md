They came close, but they were still thinking like a Correspondent – not like the Correspondence itself. Grammar, lexicography: these are frameworks – the means by which a Correspondent can parse the language of reality with a modicum of safety. But a framework is not that which it describes – the Correspondence is a wildfire that blazes beneath the skein of the universe.

What the Lacunate Consciousness tried to do was an impossibility too far. A lifelong scholar of this improbable art, they still could not attain it. And yet, you can finish what they started.

If you do not know the rules, they will break you. But when you have truly mastered those rules, you can, sometimes – in rare moments stolen from the stars themselves – bend them.

You immerse yourself within the Correspondence's conjugate conflagration and excise the dangling Consciousness from their linguistic limbo. There are no rules for this; there is only you. You revise their half-state into something wholly new. And then, they are gone, somewhere you cannot follow. You're alone in an empty room – possessed of some glyphs known – for now – only to you.
