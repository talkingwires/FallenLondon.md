"Ernie from the curtain squad told me this one night after too many Rubbery Swirls." Your inquisitive companion sits down and starts ticking off her fingers. "There are dogs and cats fighting. No, it's snakes and dogs. No, it's snakes and cats. And the Shroud are on the side of the cats, and the Glass are on the side of the dogs. I mean snakes. And all this happens in dreams." She tails off for a moment with her mouth open. "But it's not like a proper battle. It's all mystery and doing sneaky things behind the scenes."

She sucks her teeth, perhaps wishing for a Rubbery Swirl. "The strange thing is that the Shroud are on the side of the cats. So you wouldn't think a tiger would attack one of the Shroud. You'd expect a dog to do that. I mean, a snake."
