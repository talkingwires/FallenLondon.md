You run through a jungle. Orange and black, whipping past so fast you cannot be sure which colour is trunk and which is canopy. It is dawn; it is midnight. Your love waits beyond the treeline, wise and beautiful. Between you, predators.

> Stretch out your legs and close the distance like a hungry fire.

> [!choice] [[Hunted|Hide]]
> Avoid the enemy. Desire can be subtle; you can wait.
