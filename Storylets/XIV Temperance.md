story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"
---

Above wine-dark water, an angel hovers. (An angel with remarkably bat-like wings.) It's pouring a bottle into a goblet â€“ and spilling quite a lot into the water below, which might account for the wine-dark tint. On a distant shore, more bottles are heaped into mountains.
