Your knees grow sore, then lose sensation. A breeze carries zee spray; you ignore its chill. Even that inhuman scream cannot sway you from your orisons. God, and his creatures, deserve your uninterrupted concentration.

Life is the miracle through which the God's work recognises itself. For all the strange wonder of this isle, or London; or the Zee, or the Neath entire; nothing is unnatural. It exists in one accord. You are not alone, even on this lonely spit of rock. You have the harsh stone and forbidding waters; your friends in London, praying. Indeed, the only thing unnatural in the whole of the universe is the tortuous state of loneliness. Recognise life, and you will want for nothing.
