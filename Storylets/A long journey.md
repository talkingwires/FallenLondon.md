"That had been left inside the Hillchanger Tower." The Efficient Commissioner reaches into her pocket and takes out the cylindrical seal. She rolls it across the table to you.

"Keep it safely with the Seed," she says. "Safer with you than with me. I'm too old to keep fighting off the creatures that come after it."

No one intervenes. Even Mr Iron watches as your hand closes around it. It is sticky with amber: a residue, perhaps, of whoever or whatever possessed the seal after Mr Fires lost it and before the Commissioner got it back.

"I wonder," says Sinning Jenny to the Commissioner. "Have you ever considered being trained as a nun?"
