The Device to Preserve London is a two-pronged thing. One part, high up in the Bazaar's highest spire, resembles – in function, but not in shape – either a windmill meant to harness the wind, or a tuning fork meant to resonate with a vibration.

The other half resides deep below the Bazaar. That part is meant to convey something to the lacre – that vibration, perhaps.
