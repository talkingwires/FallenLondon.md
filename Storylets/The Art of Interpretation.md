"Sometimes the cards are esoteric. Sometimes they're not. Looks like you, doesn't it? And here you are. Welcome, interloper."

The Thirsty Croupier takes your face and shuffles it back into his deck.

"Nowadays, you're always in the cards. So is everyone's favourite naturalist. It's hard to get a reading without you two in the mix. This time, by some miracle, he's uninvolved."

Madame Petrovsky snorts, and the False Prophet suppresses a giggle.

"Ignore them," says the Croupier. "They're not in the Dilmun Club."

"Thankfully," says the False Prophet. "Contemptible little group."

"Now, now, darling, envy doesn't suit you," chides Madame Petrovsky.
