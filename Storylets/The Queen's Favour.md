Her Roseate Splendour leads you to a simple stone tower, deep in the depths of the dream that is Arbor. Within is a stone chair, adorned with stone roses. She sits. She does not ask you to join her. After all: where would you sit?

"You are the only one brave enough to break my edict," she says, "to light the candles in mourning. For home. For the third Arbor." She smiles, a secret smile. "Audacity must be rewarded."
