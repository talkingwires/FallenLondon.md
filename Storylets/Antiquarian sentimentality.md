Mr Pages is perusing through your bookshelves with scathing dismissal. "Chicanery. Falsehood. Literroneous poppydash. I'm sorry, did you ask something?"

You repeat the question, and the Master answers. "Tradition. An old and odd bit of history. It is important to pickle such things, to ensure their presernuity. But there is a practical purpose to our pecadillo. The coins form your stake in the game. Should you run out, why it'sâ€”" Mr Pages glances around your room, looking for inspiration. At last it alights on "Curtains!"
