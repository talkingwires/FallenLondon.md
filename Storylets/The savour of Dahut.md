A Drownie comes up through the water and the film of Effluvia washes over her face. Her eyes widen, her mouth opens in an expression that might be longing. The light gleams on her skin. Then she dives back under, as though she has been called away to a place in the deep Zee.

At last the one Drownie you seek emerges. She holds on to the side of the pier, water streaming from her hair. Her hands even now are calloused from long work. Drowning did not erase the sign of her labours.

The Clay Artisan lifts her tenderly to sit on the pier. The resemblance is clearer, now they are side by side.
