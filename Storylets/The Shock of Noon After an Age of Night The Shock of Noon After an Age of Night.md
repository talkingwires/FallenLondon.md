There is light. Searing and harsh, brilliant questing fingers of it. The faceted jungles fade beneath the tide of law emanating from the Xanthous Arrays. Shadows flee. Beneath them all are flat, silvered planes – like a house of mirrors, or the inside of the diamond.

The Seventh Coil hisses, rearing, retracting from the blazing light. The Patient Mastermind cries in triumph – behind you, the silver burns out of the eyes of the assembled crowds of tribute. Your analogues from cities past blink control back into their eyes.

# An exhortation to escape

The Patient Mastermind's hackles are well and truly up, the quiet tiger roaring and leaping through the crowds. The Seventh Coil's unwilling court shrieks and scatters, fleeing away from the rampaging tiger, blinking the Coil's silver influence from their gaze and minds. Sprinting down to aid the Mastermind, you see the method in their savagery – each growl and threat and leap is carefully calculated to send new-awakened tributes running in fear towards the light, and the way out of the prison.

You lend your efforts to theirs, shouting, gesticulating, threatening. Backed by the writhing expanse of the Seventh Coil, retreating into ever-dissolving reaches of shadow, the tributes do not need much encouragement to move in the opposite direction.
