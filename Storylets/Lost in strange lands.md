The Striped Officiant looks grave. "It is not called a labyrinth for nothing. The prison we now call the Sixth Coil was built by the very first Stained Tigers of an ancient Prince to be disorienting, an ever-changing trap. The warriors we have sent within have not returned. But it will nevertheless need to be explored and mapped, to locate the Keeper and the Seventh Coil within its depths."

His serious eyes survey the room. "It is not a simple thing. There remains always a risk of imprisonment."

***Enter the Sixth Coil and explore its depths. The cell of the Seventh Coil is hidden at its heart â€“ after enough sorties into the Coil, you may just learn enough to plot a route to lead you safely there.***
