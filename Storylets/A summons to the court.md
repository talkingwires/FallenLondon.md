_You love us in a way we thought lost._ A great rustling sound echoes from all directions, emanating from deep within the jewelled shadows of the undergrowth. _We thought perhaps we had killed_ real _love, wrest it from both Is and Not, to nestle in our chest._

Old tributes stagger from the shadowed forest to the clearing. Their eyes brim with silver, and their movements are the stilted jerks of badly handled marionettes. You use their congregations to disguise yourselves, blending in with the reeling crowds. A woman in a square-collared robe of faded silk stumbles, jarring her shin against a boulder of faceted diamond. For a moment it looks as though the jolt might clear the silver from her gaze, but it rushes back in to fill her up. She settles a few feet ahead of you, pressing her head to the ground, the leopard motif on the back of her robe faded but visible.
