The chasm below Marigold is the size of the Vatican. No light disturbs its depths: your lantern is a candle in an ocean of night.

At the heart of the abyss there is a great pillar. Something stands against it, perhaps pinned or impaled. Its breathing is laboured, its flanks heaving like bellows. Its breath is sweet as roses, perfuming the rotting of its body.


> [!choice] Approach
> You opened the gate. Why else, if not to find what lies beneath?

# Behold, the end

The shadows skitter away from your lantern as you draw near. You are a mouse compared to the colossal form, pinned against the stone. Even moving your lantern, you can only light the very base of the figure.

You stretch your arm, holding your light as high as you can. The shadow of three tines, like a fork or a crown falls over you. You are illuminating the underside of a great tongue, purple as a bruise and twisted into a spiral.

Two great wings, leathery and dappled with red and gold eyes are unfurled beside it, pinned against the stone. A thousand iron viol bows, sharpened like arrows, keep this former Prince of Hell in his place.

> [!choice] Commune with the Prince
> The many eyes on its wings regard you.


# Remembrance

The Grand Devil's wings stir but cannot move. A pale liquid like resin drips from his tongue.

One gnarled hand holds a bow of what might be ivory. Slowly, he raises it into the darkness where the devil's face ought to be. The tongue lolls and stiffens as the bow scrapes across its flesh: bereft of all else, this is how the Mandolinist makes music here.

The melody pulls like a moon-tide. Nostalgia floods the prison, shepherded by the poetry of Hell. A wave of regret washes over you, one with a vicious undertow. It ends— Then begins once more.

Again and again, the same mandolin melody. Has the Prince forgotten all other music? Perhaps it requires assistance in remembering. You step back, as the same notes fall around you, over and over.

> [!choice] Present the Mandolinist with Moonlight
> Will this restore the Prince of Hell's music?


# Hell's musicians

The Mandolinist regards you from the sight of his martyrdom, his wings fluttering where they are pinned. He requests the revealing of your moonlight, which floods the chamber briefly. For a moment, you see the Mandolinist in all of his glory, wings unfurled and his eyes weeping tunefully. The devil plays a brief note upon the horns that form its crown as the moonlight fades.

There is more work to be done. Moonlight may stir the Prince's memories, but one singer does not make a chorus. Others must be entreated. Others like the Mandolinist.

Sigils in the air ignite in white flame. There are artefacts in Hell that once allowed passage from Parabola. Such a passage could be affected again, should those artefacts be recovered. Though bound, in Parabola the Chorus could meet once again.

> [!choice] Enquire what comes next
> The Mandolinist desires a chorus.

# Hell's Horizons

The resinous scraping of the Mandolinist's bow is redolent of Hell's Hinterlands. Anthems of the Edict of Towers, newly raised. Of the goat-demons ranging wild in the hills. Of the bubbling marshes of the Lilymire.

The Mandolinist ceases to play. Its eyes gaze upon you expectantly. He has provided locations. You must do the rest. He cannot— With one movement of a gnarled hand, he indicates the pillar to which he is pinned. Then the wing-eyes close, and in his own reverie, the Mandolinist repeats his tune once more

---

# Present the artefacts

You have recovered the three artefacts of ancient Hell that the Mandolinist directed you to.

# Speaker of the Way

By bow-string and scratch, the Mandolinist instructs you in that which must be done. You place the candle from the Lilymire in a great depression in the floor, as though designed for liquid to pool there. The candle's greasy wax shines unhealthily in the light.

Next you must eat the shard of the Edict. The Mandolinist accompanies the crunching with a tune of his own, increasing in tempo as blood trickles from your mouth. Glass embeds itself beside your teeth so that, for a moment, your smile is doubled.

Finally, you don the Mask of St Trezigor, so that his wrinkled lips are your own and you see through his sockets. His voice cries out in the darkness, speaking through you in an ancient Goatish tongue.

## Summon the Chorus of Hell


> [!choice] The Mandolinist is almost ready for his music to be heard. He requires only an accompaniment.
> The presence of Parabola hangs like a raincloud over the amphitheatre. A way has been opened.

# Joining the chorus

The Mandolinist plays, a single bowstring breaking upon his twisted tongue. The echoes reverberate around the vast cavern. In distant fissures, the music of the Mandolinist continues, even as he pauses.

His wings twitch where they are pinned. A multitude of eyes open, some rheumy with cataracts, others bright as red stars. The Mandolinist awaits his chorus.

# Parabolan Thunder

Have the tunnels below the crypts grown smaller? Have you grown larger? Is this some trick of the Drummer's, to have you come to him crawling on your belly?

At last you reach the drum and the glass, brushing grave-dirt from your lips as you do. You take up the antique sticks of bone and begin to play. The skin-drum sounds in the crypts above.

The mirror reddens. Something vast and eight-legged rears. Its limbs twitch and cavort in time with the beat of your drum. Is that assent? A great hollow boom rolls like thunder, reverberating through Parabola to hurt your eardrums in Burrow. The Drummer will join the chorus

----

# Light-bearer

When the Condottiere understands your purpose, he bows, his arms crossed over his thin chest, and departs the Chapel that is the body of the Chandler. You are left alone with the window and the curtain-rope.

With one deft motion, the curtain falls to the stone with a silken swish. The glass is scarlet. There is a star – a king all in red. Vision flees.

Once you were legion. The Chandler cleaves through your head as though with a glaive. Once, you were chamberlains and cupbearers, seneschals and stewards. Then you were a discord, a glorious rebellion that pitched itself wheeling against the stars. Now you are alone. Your bones are hollow with not even wind to rattle through them.

The king has covered his face. The curtain falls. The Chandler's grief is like boiling water poured into your open head. But his resolve girds your bones. And then he is gone.

Devils enter the nave to cover the window and to lift you to your feet. The Chandler will join the chorus.

> [!choice] Hear the Mandolinist's Song
> You have brought him Moonlight, given him access to Parabola, and assembled a chorus of Hell's vanquished rulers.

# The echo

The Mandolinist strikes up a tune on its ruined crown. The glass of the shard colours: Parabola watches.

From behind the shattered glass, you feel the vast regard of the other choristers, waiting in Parabola for their cue.

You open the boxes of moonlight in the amphitheatre as the music sounds below your feet like a caged storm. The amphitheatre blurs, as the effects of the moonlight take hold.

For a moment you see the amphitheatre as it is, forgotten and forlorn. And then the Mandolinist's chords strike up. The music of Hell is stronger than these phantasms. In music and moonlight, a new vision arises. It is of something very old indeed.
