story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"
---

"The Year of the Serpent is held by the Khanate," the Thirsty Croupier explains. "Nobody else has access. Nobody else will. It's not normal airag. What is it? That's what I keep asking the cards. Somehow the Khaganians have concocted a rival to Hesperidean Cider, and enquiring minds want answers. The Dilmun Club wants answers. I found one possible answer: you."

> [!choice] [[Endorse the Croupier's interpretation]]
> A secret Khaganian plot to bottle immortality, prompting a struggle between the Neath's greatest powers, with you stuck in the middle. Yes, that sounds likely.

> [!choice] [[Scepticism|Object to the Croupier's interpretation]]
> This is rather a lot of meaning to extract from three tarot cards!
