  - "[[Of Stripes, and Coils]]"

A pair of warriors, hair braided, adorned with pendants and piercings of jade and opalescent shell, emerge from the treeline behind you. You use them as your cover for the next leg of your approach. One wears a horseshoe-like yoke around their waist, all rotting wood and faded leather. The other has a deep scar across her clavicle. They veer from side to side, as if attempting to shake off a lingering command.

_We have shown our court nothing but kindness. Unscaled, unclawed, discarded tools of a war hypocritical, we offered them secrets. And still we have to whisper them into obeisance._ The Seventh Coil gathers still, piled around the Keeper's raptures.
