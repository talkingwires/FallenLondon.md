story: "Of Stripes, and Coils"
---

Already, urchins and opportunists are making the most of the crowds, selling blankets and stolen chairs to those unwilling to soil their day-clothes. You claim a temporarily vacated spot, and bribe an urchin to keep its previous occupant away. She winks, and lifts her cap.

This close, you can smell the tigers: musk, and meat, and hookah smoke. A few feet away, a man with very red cheeks shuffles his steamer chair backwards. "I say, are we sure that it's safe here without any cages?"

The tigers in earshot freeze. A nearby woman gasps, and drops her fan. A growl bubbles by the bandstand, and commutes through the throats of each assembled feline.

Mr Inch coughs, glaring at the offending speaker. "Not to worry, good sir. I shall be escorted back into my enclosure in good time, and I solemnly swear not to maim you in the interim. No matter how tempting it may be." An uneasy chuckle passes through the crowd. In a tiger's throat, a chuckle and a growl are not so different â€“ but the predator's stillness leaves their frames.
