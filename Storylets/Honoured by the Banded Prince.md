The reception room is plush, and outfitted primarily for a tiger's comfort: futons and chaises longues, low tables groaning with meats and bowls of water. You recognise everybody here – the victors and worthies of the Coilheart Games, representatives of every delegation, even Mr Huffam, his sharp eyes missing nothing. The Striped Officiant, too, although few other tigers.

The vivid, muscled bulk of the Banded Prince occupies a dais at the head of the room. His Majesty is currently deep in conversation with his Ministers.

# Lateral moves in the hierarchy

He nods, long and slow, at your greeting. "It's 'Ambassador', now, actually." There is amusement in his voice, mixed with that familiar weariness. "Or 'Keeper', if you prefer. His Majesty requires that the posting here be filled, and deemed me most qualified." A chuff of resignation. "I am to oversee the Sixth Coil, and monitor the seals within, to prevent the need for such dishonour as has plagued us until now."

And what if the seals weaken again, and the prisoner within threatens escape? The Striped Officiant – the newly minted Tiger Keeper – chuckles. "In his wisdom, His Majesty has seen fit to permit me to do the unthinkable, and simply ask for help. We are, it transpires, not the only warriors in the Neath."

He waves a paw. "Off you go. You've got more important people to be chatting to. And I need to go and speak to a man about Walter the Rhinoceros' conduct."

# Circumventing tyrannies

He adopts a charming affect when anybody else greets him, but there's a vein pulsing on his forehead. "I have been dealt an _injunction_," he hisses through feigned smiles. "From both Her and His Majesties, 'in order to preserve diplomatic relations through times of strain and strife'. As if I could be bought. As if the truth can be gagged."

His pocketwatch is new. His moustaches are finely groomed. In recent days, it looks as though Mr Huffam has had much time to recover himself. A Khaganian dignitary approaches, and Huffam shakes his hand with vigour.

Niceties once more completed, Huffam claps a hand on your shoulder, a look of triumph upon his face. "I may not be able to risk the _Gazette_ on the story, Citizen. But I've got a novel or two left in me yet."

# Rewarded

Medallists, victors, delegation leaders: all clutch gold to their chests with the dazed expressions of people who have come face to face with royalty and been amazed at the size of royalty's fangs. It is not yet clear whether the Court of the Wakeful Eye will be able to extricate itself from this political quagmire with gold alone, but it looks as though the Banded Prince is making a solid effort. In any case, as far as rewards go, it is better than eternal imprisonment.

# A rare recognition

The Banded Prince greets you one at a time, by name. The Cackling Mechanic. The Bohemian Sculptress. The Patient Mastermind. The Weeping Mercenary. You. He speaks plainly. He does not ask you to kneel.

"We are a proud people." Lambent eyes travel down the line, and do not flinch from anybody's gaze. "We were warriors long before we were diplomats. We did what we thought we must in order to secure victory, and safety." The Banded Prince lowers his head, a deliberate act of humbling.

"But you have put us to shame. In retrieving your fellows from our folly, you have exposed our failure. They need not have been performed on our behalf for us to witness, and honour, your deeds." One by one, the Banded Prince – the Prince of the Smoking Shore and Duke of all the Isles, Archipelagos and Peninsulae that were once the Sovereignty of the Humbled Satraps – presses his forehead against your hands.

He is very warm, and very heavy: a barely contained inferno. The feeling does not fade for a long, long time after you leave the Labyrinth – a hot, fierce power in your palm.
