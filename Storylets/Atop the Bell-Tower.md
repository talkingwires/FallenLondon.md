At this height, you can see London: fires in the dark, candles in windows, lanterns on distant docks. Overhead, the great bell hangs, gleaming with the most brilliant irrigo.

Someone else has been here. A spyglass stands with its eye pointed toward the Bazaar. Graffiti covers the floor. And guano strewn with half-nibbled mushrooms.
