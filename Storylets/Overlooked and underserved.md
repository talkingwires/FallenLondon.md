"What do you know about us? Rattus faber, I mean." The Dreamer does not wait for an answer. "To most of you, we're either unusually talkative vermin, or useful labourers. We make things â€“ and we make them well. We eat less than a human, and we can live comfortably in a shoebox." There is a rising note of heat in the Dreamer's voice, and she occasionally breaks into a strained squeak.

"That is the story London tells about us. And if we don't have other ones to push back, it'll become the story we tell to each other, too." There is a deep weariness to her voice. "We're not just tiny cogs in the big machine. Being part of the machine is so tiring, so all-consuming, that it's easy to forget that. And I don't think we should forget."
