The Officiant lays out each fact simply. Death sends ripples, and ripples can be read; the Seventh Coil's sin required not cessation, but _containment_. So the Wakeful Eye constructed a prison of glass, held apart from both Is and Not by the constant expenditure of powerful glasswork. Glasswork that requires reagents: anchors and energies of the Is, sent into the prison to reinforce its wards.

"In a word, tributes. The doors of the Coil were graven with the sigils of their lives, and the presence of the Tributes within the Coil maintained the locks." His baleful eyes survey the room. "The protection of all that Is requires sacrifice. Their deaths had purpose."

The room is quiet, the bald admission draining much of the energy from the assembled victors and intriguers.
