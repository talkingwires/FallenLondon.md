  - "[[Arcana]]"

Money changes hands. Now that the Year of the Serpent is mature, financial opportunities arise. The Gracious Widow herself doesn't need to leave London; she sits at the Fifth City's criminal heart like a spider in a web. The Leopard Khan might keep her at arm's length, but his agents still reach out to hers under the table.

# Placing the correct order

You sit at a little bar in the Nephrite Quarter. You order airag: Khaganian, 1899. The Off-Duty Clerk sitting next to you orders the same and proposes a toast. You drink together.

It's the best airag you've ever tasted. Sour enough to jolt your palate. Fiery enough to flood your body with warmth, but with a gentle, soothing, creamy aftertaste.

And it's so affordable!

The Clerk tosses a few coins onto the bar. He also drops a key when he rises to leave. You retrieve it when you rise to leave yourself.

# Breaking and entering

The Khanate might glow with electric light. The Loyalty Service might post guards to patrol every bridge and canal. But if there's a shadow, you'll find it and hide; if there's a locked door, you'll slip through and lock it again behind yourself. White-and-Gold soldiers might rattle the knob, but they'll always go away, assured that everything is secure.

# Reptilian stepping stones

Crocodiles aren't native to the Salt Steppes. They're not native to London either, but after a certain incident at the Museum of Prelapsarian History unleashed a few into the Stolen River, they continued to proliferate. The Stolen River, of course, flows into the Unterzee; now the reptiles have spread across the Southern Archipelago.

The crocodiles in the Moon Canal aren't just any crocodiles. _These_ crocodiles, tamed by the Taimen to serve as aquatic guardians for the Khanate, are especially gargantuan â€“ which makes them easier to land on when you leap.

One! Two! You jump from snout to snout. Three! Four! They snap, but you've already hopped across.
