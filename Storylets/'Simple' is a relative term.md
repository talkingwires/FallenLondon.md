"Thanks to your efforts, we've mapped a route through the Sixth Coil to the cell at its heart. We're treating the route with fixative now – it should remain stable for long enough to get you there." The Striped Officiant steps back to allow the Cackling Mechanic and the Patient Mastermind the floor. You notice that the tiger has the vibrant gunk all over his own paws; he has clearly been getting stuck in.

The Patient Mastermind pushes forward five tangles of wires and bulbs, each about the size of a side table. "Once we're at the heart, this is how we'll free the Tributes and fend off the Seventh Coil," the Cackling Mechanic says. "Arrays of xanthous bulbs, all connected to a single sounder pair fitted with a contingency measure. Let go of the button, and let there be light." You note that nobody calls it a 'dead man's switch' this time. "We hope—"

The Patient Mastermind coughs. The Cackling Mechanic pauses. "Yes. We are extremely confident that flooding the cell with this light will this will weaken the Seventh Coil's influence, providing the imprisoned Tributes with an opportunity to flee."

The Weeping Mercenary steps forward. "Which is where I come in. I'll protect them, and get as many people as possible towards the exit."

"Now, the light arrays won't last long. They draw a tremendous amount of power, and we can't bring in any bigger generators. So it'll need to be quick." The Bohemian Sculptress is serious. "Once we're all out, we'll seal the door. I've been working with the Officiant to refine a binding sigil. It'll hold."
