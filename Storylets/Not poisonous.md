There are only so many tests you can perform here, with no reagents. But you can try a few things. The block does not react to honey, or wine, or to the dregs of the tea served to the boardroom an hour ago.

It isn't explosive, and it probably isn't poisonous to the Bazaar. There is one remaining test you can perform without other equipment: you touch a dab of the stone-dust to your tongue.

The impression is distant and languid. Service to a fierce and brilliant star. A cleaving birth â€“ better not dwell on this. It was painful to lose your sister-self.

Then: the Neath. Time passing, small creatures slipping past, minor affairs that are not worth looking into; and then a sudden, awful shock. You had responsibilities. You oversaw disputes and kept peace between the Sun's experiments. You thought these little animals couldn't possibly be of any concern. But you let things get out of hand. It is not too late to act.

You come back to yourself. The Board Secretary reaches curiously for the stone as well: he wants to see what you've seen. Mr Spices grasps his hand ungently and thrusts it away.

"It might kill you," says Mr Spices, in a high light voice. "Your colleague is accustomed to difficult digestions."
