"Movement through the air," says the Thirsty Croupier. "Great change. _Speedy_ change. Bullets? Possibly. Confetti? Unlikely. Flower petals? Well, recall the Devil; she's still in play. Hellish principles gird the Ace of Staves and imprison the Page of Cups. If the garden's walls should come tumbling down, there might be more than gunfire."

# Action and reaction

With every blow, the gardener bleeds â€“ not blood, but something milky-white; something with curdled clumps; something that burns whatever it touches.

Drops speckle the plants. They scream and wither. The soil sizzles. The Sacristan wriggles, its wounds clotting and closing almost instantly.

"Stomach acid. Bile," says the Thirsty Croupier. "How lovely."
