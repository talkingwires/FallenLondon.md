Virginia put on a thin pair of cotton gloves before taking the mask. She holds it up to the fire; the leather steams in the heat. "This is it. Yes." She breathes as if about to say more, but instead examines the mask, turning it over in her hands.

Finally: "This is enough. I thought I'd need to jolt the memories free from Miriam, butâ€” My victory has evidently bruised her enough. I'll let her rest." She nods. "I may need to requisition a law-furnace, but that is the Embassy's problem not mine."

Virginia takes the lid off a large tube, normally used for the safe transportation of documents. As she rolls the mask up, a trickle of zee water is squeezed out. She slides the mask safely away. As she leaves, she calls back over her shoulder. "I'm sure I'll be seeing more of you, Silverer. Thank you."

Around you, the lighthouse begins to fade back into a crooked willow tree. Something rattles through the trees ahead.
