"Yes," the Regulator says, "why the sudden interest?"

The Bishop picks up the LAWS OF THE GAME from the table and flicks through it. "I've known many people who seem to love the sport in the same way that I do my faith. They sing the hymns of their favourite teams, gather every week to celebrate their team's endeavour."

He holds the book up. "This book is nearly as heavy as the one I am used to holding. It has a good heft to it. It's not just about the game, it's about what it promotes. Communal, and physical, health. Shared identity. A belief in fairness." He places the book back on the desk with a thump. "We might all find we need that in the not too distant future."
