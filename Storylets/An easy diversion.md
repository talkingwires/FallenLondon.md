The Mary Lloyd can never resist good slapstick. You tumble calamitously across a rock in her bearer's eye line and pitch yourself into her path. What biting horse's skull could resist the allure of a prostrated tourist? The long, yellow teeth graze your ankles and clip your collar as you're chased around in circles.

You are an entertaining target for long enough that Virginia can withdraw from the island with dignity. As you head by the dock, 'Mary' finally done harrying you, you see Virginia board a boat back to London. She gives you a stiff nod.
