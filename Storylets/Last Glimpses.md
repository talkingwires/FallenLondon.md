In these last moments, the bulbs blown, the tributes fled, the Keeper flung to one side by the Weeping Mercenary's attack, you see the Seventh Coil, whole and true. An ophidian body, long as the Stolen River, banded red, and gold, and black, an undercarriage of lacre-white. A tiger's head and forepaws, large as the House of Chimes, coiling forwards at unholy speeds, before an endless knot of serpent's body.

It is so fast – it could catch you, if it wished, could slam into the golden doorway and scatter you and your allies with the sheer colossal weight and moment of its body. But it does not.

Instead, as the doors to its ancient prison close and your field of view narrows to a gold-framed slit, it darts forward to take the injured Tiger Keeper in its mouth. Its vast fangs close on the Keeper's scruff, like a mother carrying a kitten, before it winds back into the darkness of the jewelled forest. Even from your far remove, you can see the shadow of vast emotion pass over the Seventh Coil's hybrid face. You recognise it.

# A door closed

Love. You recall the jewelled vines and captive Tributes, each silver-eyed and supplicant. You recall the timbre of its voice; the way it called the Keeper 'consort'. It had not moved to escape – had not shared the Keeper's urgency. Is it possible that this, eternity with a lover, is a victory?

Words of fire flare on the lead plates, riveted to the prison's vast, golden door. They are shut. The binding catches, blazes its edict across the captive metal:

_'An oath between coiling bodies;  
a necessary injustice;  
sublimation into a larger whole;  
to be held back just shy of a threshold.'_

You slump against the door, warm at your back. The Bohemian Sculptress joins you, panting and singed. Before you, the crowd of lost champions from across the history of the Neath grapple with the realisation of freedom, the Patient Mastermind and the Cackling Mechanic helping and translating where they can.
