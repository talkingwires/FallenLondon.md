In the morning, the London air is unusually clear. The false-stars illuminate the streets more strongly than they have in weeks. Your sleep was undisturbed by any tremors, earthquakes, or sudden sinkholes.

There are still stains on your clothes from working alongside the Masters: grease, grime, less definable substances. Did you really sing to the machine? And what are those gloves you brought home with you? â€“ safety equipment from their laboratory, perhaps.

The city wakes to the sound of reconstruction. Already, gaps and cracks in the ground are being patched over with steel beams and new cobbles. Collapsed buildings are once again being raised. Hunger grips you when you awake; breakfast will not be postponed indefinitely.
