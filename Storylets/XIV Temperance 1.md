"The Gracious Widow won't be pleased," says the Thirsty Croupier. "But as long as the gardener stays shackled, she'll get her 'airag'. The first batch took centuries to digest; so will the second, but it's almost done already. The Sacristan has been eating fruit this whole time. Even if it _stops_ eating, the Khanate will still have a steady supply. All that milk will keep trickling out, batch after batch, year after year: Serpent, Stallion, Scorpion..."

"Let them look," says the Ambassador. "We got you _in_, and we'll get you _out_."

He slaps your shoulder as you zail into the darkness together.
