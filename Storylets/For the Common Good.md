"What more is there to understand?" the Bishop answers. "Camaraderie, competition, fitness. It's a sport that promotes everything London lacks and needs. I saw your games today â€“ the amount of running about, the fever pitch of emotions? Why, there's no sport like it."

You see something click in the Regulator's mind. They're almost hissing as they speak. "That's it, isn't it? I understand now."

"Understand what, my friend?" The Bishop places a calming hand on the Regulator's shoulder. They bat it away.

"You forget that I grew up hearing your sermons, your self-righteous Sunday schools. All that rot about the fibre of the nation, about fitness being an act of faith. You don't want players, you want recruits! Fighting fit for the next campaign."

The Bishop begins to rise from his seat. "Nothing so urgent. Not yet. Keeping our society fit and active and united has benefits for us all."
