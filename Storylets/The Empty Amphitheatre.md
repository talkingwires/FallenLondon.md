  - "[[Arcana]]"

An ancient arena stands high upon a hill. Colossal basalt stones lean against each other to form a colosseum. Each stone bears a sigil, larger than a London townhouse. The stone seats are gargantuan and grooved in ways incompatible with human physiology.

Grass grows in the empty arena, yellow and forlorn. A gate yawns in the ground above a vast pit, gaping like a toothless mouth.

> [!choice] Break open the gate
> Ancient laws must be broken. What was shall not be what is. You must defy Hell to restore something older.

# Against Hell

The compacts of Hell, its treaties and its new-forged laws, all refer to the binding of the one who lies under Marigold. Its imprisonment is writ into the very fabric of Hell's rule, reinforced hour by hour, amendment by amendment. The freeing of the prisoner is impossible, until the day that Hell's walls fall.

Few of the laws, however, refer to the gate itself directly. It has been built into the deepmost layers of the Neath: its bars as immovable as veins of lava.

But once it was not here. And one day it will not be here either. It is said that when the Waswood floods into Irem, what was not will become what will be, and what has been.

The dream of drowned Irem is mystical, its explorations incomprehensible. It shows a time when Irem will never be. The water drawn from its flooding docks sears the gate away in a molten sludge however, when moved through the glass.

The stairs below wait. The darkness yawns. A mandolin sounds in the depths.
