You accompany victors and sacrifices new and old into London's streets. Tributes lost to the coil for centuries take great lungfuls of fungal air. Alleys echo with voices in all the languages of the Neath.

The Fifth City, robbed without explanation of a grand celebration to cap off the Coilheart Games, needs little incitement to revelry. Spectators, competitors, opportunists and rakes take to the streets. Word spreads. The Games are over. The Coil has opened. And a party to put the Neath to shame is unfurling from within.

# Searching

You push through the crowded streets, scanning faces. The Bespectacled Choreographer leads an impromptu waltz on the cobbles. It is surely coincidence that his dancers include several ambassadors, dignitaries, and functionaries of the Shuttered Palace. You find the Shifty Tinkerer chatting with great interest to a group of Fisher-Kings about the best ways to catch messenger-bats, their legs dangling off a stretch of roof.

Further into the tangle, the Sun-Kissed Polymath calls you over, a drink in his hand. "Real stuff, from the Surface," he says, pouring you a glass. "None of your mushroom swill. I'm planning on going back up, one day soon." He grins. "The information I've sent back up should buy me a nice villa at home."

And where _is_ home, exactly?

A sly sparkle in his eyes. "I'm off to the Canal in the morning. But first, I'll look for my friend. I think we've unfinished business." The spy slips into the crowd, leaving his wine in your arms. The Rogue Translator is out there, somewhere, waiting.

# Wolf, Leopard, Eagle

The Irascible Architect loudly decries the character of London's churches and steeples to a chorus of increasing boos. The Aquiline Assistant dances with a trio in hunting leathers to the lively tunes of a fiddle player from the Singing Mandrake, who the Assistant appears to have claimed for the evening. The Striking Protector fails to hold off admirers, keeping a wine-fogged eye on her charges.

When at last you find the Diplomat-Engineer, she is surrounded by a gaggle of previous victors, faces flushed and eyes wide at London's unfamiliar streets. She excuses herself to meet you, granting you a hard-fought nod of acknowledgement.

"Much has changed since their abduction," she says, looking over the crowd. "The clans now are not as they were during the Fourth. There will be an... adjustment period." Somebody has produced a cache of airag, and the rescued Khaganians unite in a ragged – and slightly slurred – cheer.

"But we have reclaimed what we did not know was lost. And that is victory enough for today." She clasps your hand, shaking it just once. "Now. I think they are drunk enough to hear the news of the Great Khan, and the exodus across the zee."

# Lost loves

The Cackling Mechanic raises a glass to you as soon as she notices you, bellowing your name across the street so loud that bats take to the air. The Mercies, Lettice and Grace, flank her, propping the crumbling tomb-colonist up as her bandages become ever-more saturated with wine.

"Good sort, you are." The Mechanic pats you on the back with surprising force. "Look at that – swells my heart. Took her a while, but our lass found her missing beau, she did."

She points through the throng. The familiar figure of the Whispering Duellist stands not far away, facing a dark, tattooed woman adorned with jade. You do not hear what the Duellist says. Her expression is hidden by her bandages. But, as the woman leaps into her arms and tension floods out of the Duellist's frame, the emotions are clear as crystal.

The Mechanic coughs. "Give 'em a moment. But not too long! Lots of poor sods from the Third here, and I can't speak a word of it. I'm only eighty – got grandsons in Veilgarden!"

# Self-imposed distance

Back through the throng, into the Labyrinth. Only tigers remain here now, moving the wreckage of the amphitheatres, tidying up the cages, wandering the coils in haggard pairs, heads hanging low. You find the Striped Officiant himself before the ancient stone doors that lead out of the Fifth Coil and into the prison below. He looks old, the grey more prominent in the orange than you remember upon his arrival.

"I shall have to report to His Majesty," he says, speaking into the darkness. "And I have nothing to say except a litany of our shames." The entrance to the Sixth Coil swallows his words. "If I can, I shall make him feel it. The wrongs that we have done. We would have imprisoned you, and instead we are saved."

He stretches and gets to his feet. "The Banded Prince is coming, you know. Here. To 'address matters properly'. I expect you'll be implicated." He pads off towards the shallower coils. "Now, I hear there's a hyena that needs feeding..."
