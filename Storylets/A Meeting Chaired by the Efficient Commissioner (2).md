The Efficient Commissioner, not one of the Masters, has taken the Chair's seat. Mr Pages stands behind her. Mr Spices and Mr Iron are seated â€“ Iron alertly, Spices in something closer to a defeated slump.

The mood has become, if anything, slightly more pointed since the moment that the neddy men arrived. Fortunately, there is too little room in here for the Masters to come to blows with one another.
