"Thank you!" The Piebald Dreamer grins, exposing pairs of long front teeth and a tiny pink tongue. "I hoped you would understand." She searches your expression, looking for any hint of your inner thoughts, then shrugs.

"I had a couple of leads I was pursuing before that noxious beast accosted me," the Dreamer says. "Now that you're here, it should be much easier to follow them." She does not leave your shoulder until you are far, far away from the Viric Jungle's cat-infested shadows.
