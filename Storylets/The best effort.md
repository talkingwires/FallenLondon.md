Mr Pages has overwhelmed your favourite armchair, and is reading your newspaper, paying particular attention to the opinions of the salaried political columnists. When you ask your question, it folds the paper carefully, and thinks.

"A sensible question; to which I owe a comprehensive answer. When a winner expresses their heart's desire, we – that is the Masters – gather, and turn all our ingenuities and resourcements to its fulfilment. If it is possible, we shall grant it. We have never failed yet.

"After all, we have moved cities in pursuit of desire. I fear to be immodest, but our capabilities are significant."
