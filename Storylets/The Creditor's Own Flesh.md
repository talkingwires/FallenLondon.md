Mr Wines' servant Jervaise crowds into the boardroom. He is carrying a heavy square package tied with string. Postage has been paid, and it is addressed to the Bazaar 'care of Penstock's Land Agency'.

"We don't have long," says Jervaise. "The Bazaar knows something has been sent to her. She won't like it being delayed, so the next hour or so would be the time for tampering, if you take my meaning."

The Efficient Commissioner nods. Jervaise sets the package on the board room table â€“ it gives a heavy thud as it lands, like marble. The Commissioner briskly cuts the twine and unwraps a block of rough-cut stone the colour of the moon.
