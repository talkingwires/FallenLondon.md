It's like walking into a house the morning after a party. Almost nobody is here, but there are still signs from the Dilmun Club's last meeting: empty bottles, champagne glasses, sticky puddles on the floor. The Accommodating Footman must have been less accommodating after all the drinks. Still, you do find one member. She is sitting in a wheelchair next to the same table where an unpleasant specimen was previously displayed in a jar.
