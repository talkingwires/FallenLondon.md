It's not a human. It's not a serpent. It's not a Clay Man or a Rubbery Man or _any_ creature that you've seen before, but it's wearing a straw hat and gardening gloves. At least, it's wearing gloves on two appendages; the others are fleshy stumps (there are many others). It burrows through the soil. It rises, shackled, eyeless, at your side, and it keeps rising.
