It's not a human. It's not a serpent. It's not a Clay Man or a Rubbery Man or _any_ creature that you've seen before, but it's wearing a straw hat and gardening gloves. At least, it's wearing gloves on two appendages; the others are fleshy stumps (there are many others). It burrows through the soil. It rises, shackled, eyeless, at your side, and it keeps rising.

# The Sixth Sacristan

"The College of Mortality might not rule the Fifth City, but it takes an interest â€“ just as it took an interest in the Fourth, the Third, the Second, and the First. To monitor each city, the College dispatches spies. They're typically crushed when the _next_ city falls, but the Fourth City managed to capture one. It still survives, across the zee, in a prison of black rock beneath the Khanate. Now it tends the garden. Who better?"

It continues to rise, uncoiling higher, until it stretches over your head. It could keep rising; even more of its body is buried underground. Quite a lot more.

All around the garden, the soil churns as though filled with worms.

"But there's only one," says the Thirsty Croupier. "And it's no worm."
