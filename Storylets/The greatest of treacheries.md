story:
  - "[[Of Stripes, and Coils]]"
---
The Officiant is the only tiger in the room, having sent his fellows away – to much growling and flexing of claws – for this 'meeting'. Surrounded as he is, the old tiger looks small. "You have it right in your reporting." He speaks plainly, quietly, no trace of grandeur. "An old king – the seventh scion of an early Prince – engaged in the first taboo: consorting with a fingerking. Not just scheming. The stories say they were... intimate."

The Officiant's eyes are closed. "The serpent was the Coiler of Hearts, and with the scion's blessing, it took root within his mind. The union became a composite being – the Seventh Coil, born of tiger and fingerking. An anathema to our people."
