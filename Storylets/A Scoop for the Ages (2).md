Huffam's hordes of reporters have scoured London for the winners of the Coilheart Games, bringing them – by hook or by crook – to stand before him in his office. The Bohemian Sculptress. The Cackling Mechanic. The Weeping Mercenary. Tigers are conspicuously, if unsurprisingly, absent.

These newcomers join the rest of Huffam's swollen and impromptu news team of visiting dignitaries, sapphire-clad urchins, noisy tomb-colonists and turncoat spies. All read the paper, now. The print is dense; the story is long, and thoroughly told. It takes the room a while to work through the incriminating details.

_'According to our investigations, the_ Gazette _believes that all past victors – nay, sacrifices, Tributes to the gaol – are imprisoned within the Coil still. Alive. Altered by time and cruelty, perhaps, but alive.'_
