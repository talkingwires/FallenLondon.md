  - "[[Arcana]]"

"Just a friendly game of poker. We play every week," says the Croupier.

"And that tabby _cheats_ every week!" says the Enlightened Glazier.

"Prove it," says the cat.

"We've been over this! Proof has no quantifiable definition in a world whose bounds are delimited purely by the subjective and therefore illusory metrics of each individual mind. Intention shapes reality. The notion of a 'fact' is just a fantasy."

"Try shaping a reality where you're not such a sore loser." The Card-Counting Tabby lays down a royal flush.
