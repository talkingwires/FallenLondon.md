story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"
---
It's Thursday again. The Thirsty Croupier is hosting a little get-together, and you're invited. There won't be any tarot this time. No gazing into the future. He organises different card games each weeknight; Thursdays are reserved for bridge. Low stakes. Only a few players. If the regulars show up, however, there's someone you might want to meet.

They don't often have extra seats, but the False Prophet can't make it tonight.

# A familiar face

The Enlightened Glazier curses. The Card-Counting Tabby rakes coins across the table. The Indebted Deviless laughs and reaches for her purse.

"She works for the Brass Embassy," says the Thirsty Croupier, leaning over to whisper in your ear. "Diplomatic point of contact for the Khanate."

"You know that I can hear you perfectly," says the deviless. "If you're keen on Khaganian politics, there's no need to whisper. Let's talk."

Over the course of the evening, you learn more about the Eagle Khan's dreams and the Leopard Khan's nightmares than a brace of spies could root out in a month. And the Year of the Serpent? Does she have any 'diplomatic opinions' about that?

She smiles but doesn't reply. Instead, she turns to the Thirsty Croupier. "You were right," she says. "I _will_ keep my eye on this one."
