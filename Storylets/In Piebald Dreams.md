Now that she is not pinned under the toe-pad of a fearsome predator, you're able to get a proper look at your new ratty charge. A splotchy piebald specimen, she would be unremarkable by London rat standards were it not for two things. One: her spectacular doublet ensemble, complete with billowing slashed sleeves and golden needlework in tiny ratty hand. Two: she is here, in Parabola, where rats are not usually found.

She fishes a sheaf of paper from within her jerkin, unfolding a page to reveal a mad chicken-scratch mess of notes and diagrams.
