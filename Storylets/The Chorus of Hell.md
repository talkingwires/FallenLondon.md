The amphitheatre is just one of many outposts of Old Hell. From its vantage, you can see the others, speckled across the horizon like beacons. Fortresses and citadels, temples and sanctuaries. Once, Hell's arm was long.

Ahead you can see the white walls of Hell. They are not crumbling as when last you saw them. Instead, they are mantled with gold and reinforced with brass. Pennants fly above marigold-hued towers, where roses climb high.

Music plays all around. The melancholic chorus of the Mandolinist, accompanied by the dreaming devils in Parabola. The vision shall last as long as they play – and as long as you remain to bear witness.

# Hell's Herald

At its eastern front, Hell has seven walls that rise toward the city like waves. There is no gatehouse, for the Mandolinist has replaced that function. The triple-crowned king hangs from the walls like a vast moth. His great mandibles, his iridescent antenna and his many long-joined limbs rise around him like a mandala, extending deep into the city itself.

All entrants to Hell, petitioners and prisoners, dissidents and triumphant generals, pass through the variegated form of the Mandolinist. He sounds their entrance with the many bows that scour his limbs so that across the hinterlands, the anthems of Hell may always be heard. From the walls of Hell the mandolin wails like a wild lament.

# Hell's enemy

On the edge of Hell there is a fierce gleaming. It moves in the west, far beyond the bounds of the white city. It is like a forest fire roving through the woods, ghastly and pale.

When the lights of Hell are dimmed, some young devils head to it. They travel in stealth, to shelter in that great radiance beyond Hell. Those that return carry that livid radiance with them like a beacon.

Hell sends its cannon and its edicts against the radiance. In every sortie, the royal regiments of Hell are annihilated. The light burns on, defiant.

# Parabolic Saints

Where once there will be a church, a temple rises. Its towers are horned, its facades made of twisted vines. Serpents conspire within the greenery, while, in the roofless chambers, acolytes dance in wild abandon. A drumbeat rolls like thunder from deep in the earth below.

The devils carry effigies of their Saint, crowned in serpents. His arms are thronged with vines while snakes cleave to his strong limbs. They hold him up cruciform, so that he resembles a caduceus.

Around the temple, the hedges grow high. Violets hang in the greenery, watchful and poisonous. Guards stand at the archways, gazing balefully out to where Hell's walls glower.

# The end of revels

The moonlight wanes. The boxes in the amphitheatre empty, their luminosity diminishing and the visions fading into phantoms, and then to nothing at all.

For a few lonely minutes, the Mandolinist plays on. The screech of his bow sounds around the colosseum, accompanied faintly by the high singing of the other Grand Devils, dreaming beyond the glass. It is a chorus of bells and screams, of weeping and wine and then, at last, silence.

The Mandolinist has a gift for you, a fraction of his former tribute. Has the vision pleased him? Red stains run from his good eyes on his tattered wings. He does not ask you for a reprise. Kings do not ask for encores. But his eyes follow you as you climb the stairs and into the light.
