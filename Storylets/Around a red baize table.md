  - "[[Arcana]]"

Tapestries from Vesture cover the walls. Khaganian carpets line the halls. You're escorted through sitting-rooms and parlours filled with velvet couches, beaded curtains, urns, antiques, potted plants and cut flowers, taxidermy ranging from the leopard to the leech, grandfather clocks, astrolabes and hourglasses.

Surrounded by mounted skulls and crossed sabres, other guests are playing poker as they drink champagne. Is that Madame Petrovsky? None other. The False Prophet of Lacewhisper Street folds. An Enlightened Glazier ups the ante while a Card-Counting Tabby licks a paw.

They're too engrossed to notice you, but the Croupier raises his glass.

"Right on time," he says, taking a sip.
