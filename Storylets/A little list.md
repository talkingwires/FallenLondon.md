Mr Pages is distracted by a book of inadequate poetry. "Why are modern poets so dull? Where is their vim? Their insouciance? Their transloquacity?" It tears itself away to attend to your question.

"Allow me to think a moment. I rarely have the occasion to call on them."

Mr Pages produces a pen, and eventually hands you an ink-blotted list. It reads:

> The Manager: often perambulates London at night, searching for those afflicted, to collect for his hotel. You will need to be more than a little mad to find him.

> The Topsy King: roosting in the Flit.

> Virginia: regularly ensconced at Dante's Grill, Ladybones Road.

> The Monkey: sating its debased appetites and repulsive addictions in Wolfstack Docks.

> The Bishop of St Fiacre's: at his charming church, near Spite.
