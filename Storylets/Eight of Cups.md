"Foreign captains won't be permitted to dock," says the Thirsty Croupier. "Trade disputes? War? I can't tell. The Loyalty Service will patrol the Copper Quarter and blockade the Bridge of Sighs, but the Eight of Cups suggests a covert journey across water. You'll leave London's comfort. You'll enter the Khanate – by which route?"

# Across the Smouldering Sea
By the Khagan's decree, mirrors must have a flaw. Any unbroken silver might open a doorway into Parabola, and the Khaganians have a fraught history with the dream-dwelling creatures that slither behind the glass.

But you know an Enlightened Glazier who lives in the Sinking Quarters.

From your own looking-glass, you'll embark on a four-month voyage. Four months will stretch into eight. Wounds will open in the sky, great blood-drops bead amongst the stars and fall, crashing, into the waves, as a razor nicks somebody's neck. The moon – a circular shaving-mirror – will finally rise on the day you arrive.
