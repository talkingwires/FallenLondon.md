A forked tongue. Whiskers like copper wire. Scales and furs and rippling muscle, striped in gold and red and black. Those vast ophidian eyes, commanding the Keeper's adoring gaze, roving at last across its assembled court, silver-eyed, obeisant, captive for all these years.

You are in place. You are not hidden. The Seventh Coil sees you at last.

# The too-long caesura between action and consequence

_Interlopers._ The voice of the Seventh Coil fills the too-small vessel of your mind, focused for the first time on you alone. _Have you come to kneel?_ It is knowing, rather than hearing. _To love?_ The roar of a waterfall. The whisper of a promise. _To don fur and scale and become us?_

The Tiger Keeper's lambent eyes land upon you, the bliss there evaporating as he recognises you, recognises your fellows. His face bursts into a snarl, muscles bunching, moving from the throne in a fluid movement. "Noâ€”"

And you let go of the button.
