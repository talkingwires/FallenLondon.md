"Always, we of Skite seek to prove ourselves," they intone. "To redeem ourselves. If there are innocents imprisoned, we should free them. But we know all too well what comes of releasing those who have earned their sentence." They look down, so that you cannot see their face. "The Seventh Coil is a delicate matter, and I do not trust myself to speak with confidence."
