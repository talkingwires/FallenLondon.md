The entrance of the Labyrinth of Tigers is transformed. Paths, limned by rainbow fires, funnel the crowd through temporarily emptied cages and enclosures and towards the great lawn at the heart of the Labyrinth's most accessible coil.

It is here that the largest of the tigers' amphitheatres has been constructed. It teeters above the Labyrinth's low buildings, a sprawling tiered oval built around the great lawn, and occasionally on top of an outbuilding or two. Faux-stone cladding disguises the creaking wood and rusted iron of its construction from view, veiling each edifice in the aspect of an ancient and crumbling ruin. It is a fitting performance: the main amphitheatre sways with the weight of the people crowding its tiers.

# Bird's-eye view

It feels as though all of London has turned out for the ceremony. The tigers' construction has little respect for class or station, so well-heeled Elderwick socialites vie for position alongside the grubbiest Wolfstack dockworkers. As you climb the tiers of precipitous seating, you witness a diminutive factory worker rowing with the tremendously tall and overcoat-clad gentleman sat in front of him. By the time you find a seat on the highest tier, the tall gentleman has split apart into two component urchins, giggling and scampering off to find a less belligerent vantage.

Your own seat requires no such violence, although the creak of the wood as you settle your weight upon the bench is not reassuring. Before you stretches the great lawn of the Labyrinth – now covered in jewelled and vibrant mosaic. The once-wilted expanse now depicts a glittering jungle, replete with flowers and birds of paradise; emerald, ruby, sapphire.

# Across the Neath

Hundreds – nay, thousands – of Londoners of all shades, sizes, and gradations of cleanliness, are here for the celebration. In amongst the throng, picking one face is nigh impossible. But there are patterns.

Down there, a ground-level paddock built especially for Clay Men, who would otherwise obliterate the stands' wooden seating. Up opposite you, in the gods, a gaggle of Rubbery Men twitch at the noise, tentacles entwined. And is that a group of Rattus faber you can see beneath the lowest level of seating?

There are other outliers, too, the traces of visitors' passage. There's a small but noticeable gap around the delegation from the Eagle Clan, sitting stiffly upright in Khanate finery. A moment later and you can spot the tomb-colonists from the Grand Sanatoria – they must be in the dusty stretch of crowd attempting to start a sing-along to a ditty two decades out of favour. Of the visitors from the Surface, there is no sign – either they're assimilated perfectly, or they got lost on the way.

And the tigers? Why, here they come now.
