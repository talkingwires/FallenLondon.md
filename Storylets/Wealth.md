His Amused Lordship has influence, friends, and a great deal of capital. Perhaps it shouldn't be surprising that he's involved in this venture.

The second board member is the Efficient Commissioner. One of the investors explains over drink: "The Bazaar wouldn't let us lay as much as a mile of track in a Westward direction without her. Something about a bad incident a few centuries ago. Not To Be Repeated."

The Commissioner carries a complete copy of the Tragedy Procedures of the Bazaar. She will scrutinise the Board's every move to make sure it is unlikely to cause any further mishaps.
