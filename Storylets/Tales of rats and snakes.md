"The Knot of Tales is a Fingerking, I think." An ophidian power of Parabola, and the ancient antagonists of the cats of dream. "Some of the stories say that it appeared as a writhing knot of tails. Some of them say rats' tails, even. But –" she almost pauses, as if unsure about putting forward her hypothesis "– tangled tails is just a common anxiety dream. I'm pretty sure it's a snake."

She thrusts a finger at an illegible corner of scrawl. "I found something about a Garden of Knots, too. Which might be its prison – where it's keeping the Chroniclers." A pause. "Or the Garden might be a metaphor. Or a maze." She grimaces, and flicks her tail around so that it wraps around her, protective. "Only the really old rats remember the story, and none of them remember the same things. It's definitely in Parabola, though. Somewhere dangerous, where rats don't normally go."

She sighs, and kicks a puff of dirt from the undergrowth. "I thought I could just ask. I thought Parabola would be friendlier."
