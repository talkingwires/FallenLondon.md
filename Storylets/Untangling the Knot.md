"The way to the Garden of Knots is supposed to be blocked." The Piebald Dreamer's eyes are bright with fervour. When excited, she gestures emphasis with pink paws, almost unbalancing herself with thoughts too large for her tiny frame. "Safe entry has to be bought. The price: a story. Something –" she closes her eyes as if reciting old knowledge "– that walks the line between myth and truth."

She deflates a little, crumpling her doublet. "And then we need to know where the entrance lies." A rueful crinkle of the nose. "That's what I was trying to determine when you, er. Stepped in."
