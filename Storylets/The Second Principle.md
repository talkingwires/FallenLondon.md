A Steward leads you on a leash into another room, which is not a surgery. A surgery wouldn't have this much straw on the floor. It might, on the other hand, be splattered with blood, but this isn't blood either. It's far too red. It's far too rich. It dribbles from the stitches that cover the thing in the corner, which cowers at your approach.

It's also wearing a leash.

You aren't so different from the thing wearing the leash. Indeed, the more it peels apart, crimson torrents pouring through its skin, the more you peel apart. There's only one leash, isn't there? The Steward closes the door â€“ to give you a little privacy with the mirror.

Once you've sloughed your fur, your horns, your hooves, there is no mirror anymore. You've walked along a rose-red road, unravelling, until you are not what you were. Now you are what you are, and Arbor opens its arms like a mother to embrace a wounded child.
