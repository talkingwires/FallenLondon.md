"It is just what you people call it in this age. A dance performed in moonlight. The moonlight causes a vision of the Surface, the world without the Neath. The Totentanz makes it real. Enough to kill, at least." Mr Wines is being exceedingly forthcoming.

The Master sighs. "But the Totentanz is a very particular thing. It needs the right steps to the right music, played with the right instruments. And they're lost. All lost. It's so easy to misplace something you only use once an age, you see. And without them, the Totentanz is just a sorry soiree. And a violation of an important contract."
