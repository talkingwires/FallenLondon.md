  - "[[Of Stripes, and Coils]]"
---
The Officiant shows his fangs in what is probably meant to be a smile. None of the assembled victors move to object. Huffam looks delighted, fumbling in his waistcoat for a spare notebook and pencil.

It is the Bohemian Sculptress who finally says it. "With the five of us, I think we can do this." The question hangs in the air.

Before you lies a prison built to contain a creature anathema to both sides of the glass. For centuries, none who have entered its heart have returned. The group before you aim to be the first. And they desire you beside them.


## [[Last, but not least|Accept, as is your right]]

It may not have been as glamourous as an overall Tournament win, but your achievements entitle you to a share of the Coil too. That right has not been rescinded now you know that the Coil is a vasty, mirrored prison.

## Accept, on behalf of the story

Posterity will only benefit from a tenacious pursuer of public truths being present to record this final effort.


## Accept to keep an eye on the other winners

Their allegiances are myriad and motives suspect. You'll go along to make sure all continues to London's – or just _your_ – benefit.


## Accept to satisfy your curiosity

Ever since the Coilheart Games were announced, the question of the Sixth Coil has led you here. You'll see this through to the end, and get the answers you desire.


## [[A refusal of the call|Nominate Mr Huffam in your stead]]

He has fought hard to bring this story to light. Is he not at _least_ as trustworthy as your good self?
