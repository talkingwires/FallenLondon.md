"Jumping to conclusions is my specialty," says the Croupier. "I typically land on two feet. But I'll admit I have other sources. The cards are just confirmation. The Year of the Serpent is legendary. At least, it _was_ – until this week. Communiqués intercepted by the Khaganian Ambassador's mistress confirm that the vintage is real."

He tosses a sheaf of papers onto the table.

"The Khanate is starting to move. She's indebted, by the way. His mistress. Can't bluff. Shouldn't gamble. I tell her every Thursday. Good thing she doesn't listen."

These files document a bidding war between great houses in Khan's Heart. If the Year of the Serpent is merely a myth, it's the kind that can bankroll kingdoms.
