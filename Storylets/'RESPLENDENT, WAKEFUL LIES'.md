_'The_ Gazette _can report this morning, after an extraordinary effort of international journalism, the truth of the Labyrinth's oft-touted Sixth Coil. We shall not bury the lede. We have all been deceived...'_

The facts are collected, bald and unforgiving, the city's Neathwide investigations distilled into a grim expose. It was – had always been – a trap. The Sixth Coil does not contain treasures, but a _creature_. A union of enemies, royal tiger and serpent-of-the-glass, imprisoned within a mirrored cage. To keep the creature imprisoned, the gaol requires maintenance; it requires energy. It requires _sacrifice_. And so, selected for their strengths of body, of intellect, of imagination and invention, tributes are offered to the glass: the victors of the Coilheart Games.
