Money changes hands. Now that the Year of the Serpent is mature, financial opportunities arise. The Gracious Widow herself doesn't need to leave London; she sits at the Fifth City's criminal heart like a spider in a web. The Leopard Khan might keep her at arm's length, but his agents still reach out to hers under the table.

# Suspicious bookkeeping

London's Embassy is dilapidated. The halls are dark. The diplomats are gone. It's a miracle that Her Enduring Majesty's portrait, defaced with unspeakable graffiti, still hangs above the front desk. Most of the filing-cabinets and vaults have been ransacked, but a discerning eye can read the tactics of a battle even in the aftermath.

Before their evacuation, the Embassy's staff documented the Leopard Clan's transactions with the Peaceable & Godly Trading Company. Payments rendered. Cargo transported. The Eagle, the Wolf, the Taimen, and the Tortoise Clans also placed unusually large orders.

You slip past guards. You evade dogs. You crawl under the western pier, then climb aboard the _Sunday Service_ by squeezing through a porthole.

Foreign trade is currently prohibited, but that didn't stop the _Sunday Service_ from moving cargo to London just last week.

The logs are innocuous. Too innocuous. This ship delivered over fifty crates from the Palace of Jade itself. Those crates contained nothing more, apparently, than salted fish.

Fifty!

If those 'fish' are what you think they are, then the Gracious Widow won't need to import any brandy from the Elder Continent until the Seventh City falls.

# Direct interrogation techniques

If the five Noble Clans have any point of weakness to exploit, then that weakness is the Rat Khan. His sons are malcontent. His daughters are treacherous. His advisors contradict him in open court, and even his assassins are undisciplined.

His Master of Poisons is only too willing to talk. Not that she has much to _say_. She tells you about certain compounds extracted from plants in the Khagan's garden, but she's never seen the garden. It must be in Khan's Glory, but she doesn't know the location. It must be spacious, but Khan's Glory doesn't have enough space for such a large plot.

# History and legend

Blue fire burns in a barrel. The Broken Step feeds it with coal. The Banister regales you with ancient tales, passed down from urchin to urchin for generations.

"...carried a silver sapling through the mirrors. All the Great Khan's treasures. The last _True_ Khan, they call him now. But the five clans still honour the old alliance. They keep the Great Khan's garden locked. He brought seeds to the Salt Steppes when he knew the Fourth City was doomed."

"And a gardener too!" adds the Squeaky Step.

"And a gardener too," confirms the Banister. "Still the same one to this day..."
