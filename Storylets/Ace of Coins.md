Money changes hands. Now that the Year of the Serpent is mature, financial opportunities arise. The Gracious Widow herself doesn't need to leave London; she sits at the Fifth City's criminal heart like a spider in a web. The Leopard Khan might keep her at arm's length, but his agents still reach out to hers under the table.

# Suspicious bookkeeping

London's Embassy is dilapidated. The halls are dark. The diplomats are gone. It's a miracle that Her Enduring Majesty's portrait, defaced with unspeakable graffiti, still hangs above the front desk. Most of the filing-cabinets and vaults have been ransacked, but a discerning eye can read the tactics of a battle even in the aftermath.

Before their evacuation, the Embassy's staff documented the Leopard Clan's transactions with the Peaceable & Godly Trading Company. Payments rendered. Cargo transported. The Eagle, the Wolf, the Taimen, and the Tortoise Clans also placed unusually large orders.

You slip past guards. You evade dogs. You crawl under the western pier, then climb aboard the _Sunday Service_ by squeezing through a porthole.

Foreign trade is currently prohibited, but that didn't stop the _Sunday Service_ from moving cargo to London just last week.

The logs are innocuous. Too innocuous. This ship delivered over fifty crates from the Palace of Jade itself. Those crates contained nothing more, apparently, than salted fish.

Fifty!

If those 'fish' are what you think they are, then the Gracious Widow won't need to import any brandy from the Elder Continent until the Seventh City falls.
