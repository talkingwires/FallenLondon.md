Space crackles around you like taffeta. You ignore the Masters' dismay. "The promise!" cries one. And: "Do not abandon us! We are too few!" That one might be Spices. You close your ears.

All around you, the Judgements shine in infinite array: the armies of the Known and the Seen. The Bazaar, the Sun, the world of your birth, are grains of sand on a beach. Even the Neath is a dark and tiny wound. Out there in the night: the forge of souls, the dragons which consume time, the egg that hatched Parabola. Now they will be yours.

You spread your wings: wind fills them, the wind from the Judgement that you once called the Sun. You rise and take your place among the worlds.
