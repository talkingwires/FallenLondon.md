# Figures from myth

"I'm on a quest," the Piebald Dreamer repeats, lowering her voice as if she hadn't just been shouting this fact to an angry panther and all the Parabolan undergrowth. She narrows her eyes at you, then relaxes. Your success at saving her from feline consumption has earned you some measure of trust. "I'm looking for the first ratty historians â€“ the Endless Chroniclers." She rifles through her tiny notebook, shedding the odd page. "All the stories say that they're trapped somewhere here, in Parabola."

She crinkles her nose, and her whiskers twitch wildly. "All the stories I could find, anyway. The other rats haven't been helpful. The other rats _forget_."
