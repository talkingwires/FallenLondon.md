"We can use the story of the Chroniclers and the Knot of Tales!" She beams. "It'll take out two cats with one stone. I have a few gaps left to fill anyway. We can ask the Whisker-Ways."

She pauses, considering you from your own shoulder. "The Whisker-Ways are our... dreaming-places. Rats are better neighbours to each other than you lot. Even our dreams are close together. It'll be easier to show you." She totters off in an apparently random direction.

**Enter the Whisker-Ways with the Dreamer to obtain a finished myth of the Knot of Tales.**
