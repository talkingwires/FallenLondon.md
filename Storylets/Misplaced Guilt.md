"The single survivor of my father's squad I told you about? This is him," explains the Regulator. "For whatever sense of misplaced guilt he's carried back from there, he's interfered in my life ever since. Thanks to him I've been interred in beastly schools, forced into dreary jobs, and saddled with acquaintances and courtships I never asked for."

The Bishop opens his mouth to speak.

"No," says the Regulator, "I have heard it too many times before. I don't know what happened out there. I don't want to know why you are wracked with so much guilt about my dad. That's between you and his soul, God rest it. I want nothing from you and no more than that."

"Not even this job?" says the Bishop. The Regulator sighs.
