# The Gates of the Garden

You know which shrine to visit. You know which cups to pour. You know which sigils to draw when your offering pools in the basin, reflecting the blue dome above.

When the Great Khan left the Fourth City, he led his forces to the Elder Continent. He fought. He failed to stake new claims. He zailed to the Salt Steppes instead, to the black rock where he founded the Khanate. Now overgrown with wharves, warehouses, palaces, and parks, the black rock is hidden beneath the canals.

But step into the basin when it drains. Descend the spiral staircase that's revealed. You'll enter a great chamber, carved into the rock itself, where a secret garden flourishes.
