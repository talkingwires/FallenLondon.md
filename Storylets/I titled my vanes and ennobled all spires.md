The air of the Neath is notoriously calm. Wind is a stranger, here. But tonight, you conjure a storm. A whistling gale whirls the weathervanes and rattles the windows. Percussive thundercracks keep time. Cups shiver in their saucers, chiming prettily. Your loft booms like tuba as the air pressure changes.

Mr Pages, in your drawing room, waltzes clumsily to the aerological symphony. You watch, carefully, as it performs some soaring dance of heavens long since abandoned. Beneath its robes, shapes stir and bulge, as if trying to break through the cloth. Are those wings?

"Home," it says, its voice slurred. "I want to see the stars again."
