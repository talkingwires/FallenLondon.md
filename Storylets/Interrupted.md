Before the Efficient Commissioner can comment on this point, there is a rapping on the door: two beats, then three, then two.

The neddy men look at the Efficient Commissioner, confused. "That will be Jervaise now," she says. "I told you to expect the signal knock."

"Yes, ma'am, but it was seven knocks," says one of the men, apprehensive. "Seven."

"And from the sounds of this Creditor, who's to say it didn't send a bomb?" asks the second neddy man.

"Open the door," says the Commissioner.
