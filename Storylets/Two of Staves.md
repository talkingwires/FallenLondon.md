By certain signs, his servants recognise you. They don't know your name, your face, or your intent, but they escort you through back stairwells to their master. You meet him in various establishments, private homes, and even the Floating Ballet. His loyalties may shift like sand, but tonight his allegiance is yours.

# Inside information

He turns to look at himself in the glass. (It's broken, of course, by the Khagan's decree: _All mirrors must have a flaw_.) He lifts a ruby earring to one lobe, tuts, and sets it aside.

"What do you think? Moon-pearl?" he asks, lifting another earring.

Ladies laugh in an adjoining room. A gong resounds.

"I've had it up to _here_," the Ambassador says, "with these social functions. We're celebrating what, exactly? Our leash and collar? The fortunes squandered on that d__n airag could build an army. _Two_. I think moon-pearl."

He hooks the string of pearls into one ear. He waves his valet forward.

"Yours, I believe," he tells you, indicating a bundle on the tray in his valet's hand. "Don't make me regret doing this."

# Inside information (2)

The Khaganian Ambassador isn't really watching the ballet. With his opera-glasses, he scans the audience from his private box.

"She knocked over the first domino," he tells you. "She's probably been plotting this for centuries. Hell has, at least. But I don't care. I've _seen_ the garden with my own two eyes. Year after year, I bit my tongue. Not just about the Leopard's little 'bargain' with the Widow. Now the others are begging for scraps. I won't beg."

Across the theatre, a woman in blue silk unfolds a crimson fan.

"That's the signal," says the Ambassador. "Go."

# Identifying another contact

Blue brocade. Black silk. Purple sleeves and indigo slippers. Wherever you look, people move like embroidered shadows – but there! You spot a crimson caftan in the Square of Cedars. Nobody else is wearing such brilliant fabric.

The Storyteller in Crimson is singing to a crowd. His voice rumbles, thrumming, doubled in his chest and throat. Wind. Rain. Rolling thunderheads. He fills the square with harmonies that open the sky in your memory, and then he steps aside after the performance.

You follow him down labyrinthine alleys.

"Through here," he says. He opens a tea-shop window. "Good luck."

"They _know_," says the Ambassador. "Or they suspect. That's worse!"

He paces the disused parlour on the second floor. White sheets cover the furniture.

"I'll have to go back down there and pretend. No worse than bluffing the Banded Prince, I suppose. But here – take this. You need it more than I do."

He tugs his necklace loose: a Horsehead Amulet.

"Don't contact me. I'll contact you. But let's get one thing straight: I'm not doing this for the Year of the Serpent. I'd rather drink the Khagan's chamberpot. Steal a bottle. Leave it. Either way, that's _your_ prerogative. But that garden shouldn't exist. There's enough cruelty in the world."
