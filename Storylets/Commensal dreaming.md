The Piebald Dreamer frowns. "Why wouldn't we dream? We think. We invent." A wrinkle of the nose. "Just because you don't see us doesn't mean we aren't here." She paces the mossy jungle floor. She pauses now to examine you â€“ to really look at you closely. "We have our own places, like the Whisker-Ways. But we're everywhere, too. You're just so used to ignoring us that you tend not to see us, even here."

The Dreamer slumps in the dirt, her little legs splaying to either side as her immaculately stitched breeches ride up. "Now that I'm trying to be noticed, it's all been going wrong. I thought cats were supposed to be helpful, on this side of mirrors."
