Even in the stillness, the colours bleed and waver. Orange and black, dawn and void. You hide; make yourself still. They will expect you to run, will expect your love to overpower your sense. But you have waited too long to be impatient now.

It pads past your hideaway in the zoetrope jungle: a predator. You keep your face averted and hold your breath. You know what you will see if you look. Your enemy looks just like you.
