The Efficient Commissioner lists the three things needed to meet the Creditor's demands: a Seed of the Cedar that is used to seal the bargains of the First City; the Seal of the Bazaar that was first granted to the Sleeping Merchant; and a currency that will serve for a security.


> [!choice] [[Wild Geese|Admit to having the Seed of the Cedar]]
> It has been with you since you retrieved it from Hillchanger Tower, when you went there looking for Furnace Ancona.

> [!choice] [[A long journey|Ask about the Seal of the Bazaar]]
> You did see it, but you didn't take it.

> [!choice] [[Offer to give whatever is needed]]
> Better that than to let the Creditor wreak some unspecified vengeance.

> [!choice] [[Interrupted|Pointedly indicate that you're not providing the payment]]
> Perhaps the sum will not be as vast as she once feared, but the Creditor will still want a substantial payment. She is mistaken if she wants the GHR to pay it.
