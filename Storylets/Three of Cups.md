Khan's Glory is glorious tonight. The five Noble Clans are feasting together for the first time in a lifetime. Tortoise and Taimen have lain their swords aside (and concealed their daggers); Eagle and Wolf raise their cups to a brilliant future (each waiting for the other to drink first); and the Leopard Khan himself pours airag for another toast.

# Towards a golden future

Servants scamper through banquet-halls, bearing silver platters. The Wolf Khan calls for more marmot. The Taimen Khan demands dumplings. Ten goats, de-boned and stuffed to bursting with vegetables and red-hot coals, roast until the fat leaks from their tender flanks â€“ and the carving-knives flash. The tables, packed with great lords and ladies, will feast until morning, providing you with enough time to slip, unnoticed, into the Yellow Chamber; then the Green; then the Purple; then White.

You seek out shadows. You climb through windows.

You drop into a courtyard and make for a gate.
