Entering is easy as breathing. The Patient Mastermind follows close behind, breath prickling your neck. The others behind, The Bohemian Sculptress sparing a final glance back at the light as you go.

The mirrors, the doors, the sights and sounds, all shimmer with the silvery-green of viric. Each of you has rehearsed the route like a mantra. The Cackling Mechanic mutters it as you go.

North-west through the sculpture garden, where the cypresses cradle an empty pedestal (upon which you would fit as if born to it). Widdershins around the field of spears, closing your senses to the seductions of far-off battle. Up, up through the tattooed offices, walls pleading for you to lend them your skin. Finally, you burrow into the shedding-places, ignoring the itch to leave yourself behind.

Together you slip through the maze of the Sixth Coil like cutpurses in a crowd, following the blessed stasis of the viric fixative. In your wake, you know, the Sixth Coil yearns to turn and change â€“ but it is enough. You are here. The route holds firm. Before you stand the great and gilded doors to the Seventh Coil's home-in-exile.

# The Heart Inescapable

The double doors are vast, towering out of the Coil like a transplant from an ancient temple. They are gold and jewelled, inlaid with motifs of the deep jungle. Vines hung with serpents, and prowling cats, eyes in ruby and emerald.

They are also wide, wide open. Are you too late?

## Listen at the door

All your plans are for nought if the Keeper and the Seventh Coil have already escaped.

# All in place

The space beyond is dark. The air within is hot and humid. All is not quiescent; rustles, like foliage beneath a tiger's bulk. Bassy rumbles as of the contemplation of the earth. A distant, plaintive snarl. Even muffled, you recognise the voice: the Tiger Keeper.

You signal to your companions. The plan can go ahead.
