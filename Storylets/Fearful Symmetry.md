Guttural fury behind you. Claws on metal. A glimpse of white and orange and death â€“ the Tiger Keeper, mid-leap, fangs bared, maw a black and terrible void. His words are lost in his roars.

Light lacerates the scales of the Coil, and the Keeper pounces _through_ them, passing through pained walls of suddenly unreal flesh in the long arc towards your body.

# Reprieve

The Weeping Mercenary ducks below the Keeper's lunge, and thrusts upwards with a dagger. A howl of rage and pain as the leap turns to a tumble, and you are forced to leap to one side to avoid the Keeper's uncontrolled, writhing fall.

The Mercenary pulls you back. A new wound, fresh and vivid, blossoms by their temple. "Can't take him in a straight fight," they pant. "Go." You sprint on together, making the most of the opportunity, hurrying straggling tributes in the garbs of cities past.
