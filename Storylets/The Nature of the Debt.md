"All our recent accounts of this debt suggested that it was originally a toll," says the Efficient Commissioner. "A price charged for crossing a mountain pass, calculated on the number of souls in the whole Neath â€“ a strange custom! Why would you extract a cost even for people who were not going through the tollgate?"
