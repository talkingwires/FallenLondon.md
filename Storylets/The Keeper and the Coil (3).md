In the flickering, faceted light of this unreal jungle, the winners of the Coilheart Games are wild and fierce. One by one, you creep through the forest. A bud of metallic silver blooms at your passage, revealing petals of razor-thin ruby. A fern of gold leaf furls up in avoidance of your touch.

_Not like these graceless recusants._ Coil upon coil of the creature hauls itself out from the forest now, mountains of scale and flesh. The Keeper's eyes do not move from its great, swaying pupil, still ensconced in shadow.

>Deeper into the clearing, there are fewer places to hide. All around you, tributes press their faces to the floor, ignored by Keeper and Coil.
