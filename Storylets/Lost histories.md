"It's not just a story!" The Piebald Dreamer flares up, immediately defensive. Her voice rises to a shrill squeak, and she turns pink, grooming her whiskers while staring down at the jungle floor. "Sorry. My –" she searches for the right words, "– lots of rats don't believe me, I guess."

"But the Endless Chroniclers are real. I found their dreams, deep within the hidden nooks of Parabola. They're survivors from the days of the Saint, trapped here in Parabola by a vast and ancient power. I don't have the whole picture yet, but I know they're here. The recorders of our ancient history, kept as prisoners by something that eats stories. The Knot of Tales."
