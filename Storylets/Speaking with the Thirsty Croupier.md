    description: Speak with the Thirsty Croupier
story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"
---

Never without a beverage at his elbow, the Thirsty Croupier shuffles and cuts cards. There may be other people in the room, but when his gaze is trained on you, it feels as though you're alone together. Somewhere in the shadows, a clock ticks. Coals settle in a smouldering fireplace. Lacquer masks peep over your shoulder from the walls.
