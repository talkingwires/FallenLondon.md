"The Newest returns with more News."

It must be a line she has said many times; she speaks like an actor reciting a script. But she touches her temple in confusion. What is the next line?

"No doubt you wonder how I talk," she says, regaining her rhythm. "I was foolish. They had to cut it out. Another grew." She opens her mouth, welcoming you to examine her tongue. A plumper, redder, and more luscious tongue you've never seen. Succulent, like an ideal strawberry. "From a seed. From the forest that bleeds."

Upon closer inspection, her taste-buds really do resemble seeds on a strawberry's skin, tiny pearls cushioned in crimson pockets.

"I know you wish to consult the Bishop. I know many things. I will arrange a meeting. Until then, not a whisper. Orchard House listens."

***In due time, the Bishop of St Fiacre's will contact you for a private meeting. You should keep these developments to yourself before then. Who knows what the walls might overhear?***
