Mr Pages drains the last of your port. "It is your insight that I have come to admire the most." it says.

"We have an underrangement with the eponymous Mr Storridge, of Storridges Publishing House. He will manufacture one entirely standard deck of playing cards for us. This to prevent tampering."

Pages sighs; the sigh of a long life of disappointment and deep familiarity with the failures of the human and inhuman conditions. "If the cards are tampered with, you would be held responsible. That would be mispleasant.

"Once they are procured, then the unfortunate business of expense, deadly journeys, etcetera, can begin."
