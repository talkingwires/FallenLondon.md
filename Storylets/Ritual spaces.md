You pivot the spyglass. Those fires, those candles, those lanterns on docks: they are points in a web, and their threads converge here. You are standing at a pentagram's centre.

Memories tug, and you glance overhead. [[Irrigo]] glints on the bell. Of course you'd seen it before. Of course. When you first climbed the tower. And of course you'd forgotten. [[Irrigo]] is the colour in which recollections are lost.

You turn away before you can forget again. This bell-tower has been prepared, aligned as a beacon that rises high above the tournament. When the right hour strikes, who knows how many people might forget, or what they might forget.
