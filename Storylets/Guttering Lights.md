_No!_ The Coil's shout in your mind is a physical pressure, pushing against the backs of your eyes. _Our beloved!_

Lights flicker. A _pop_ from ahead. As a bulb explodes in the array before you and the lights of law weaken, the vast, scale-furred reaches of the Seventh Coil fling themselves out from the shadows. Loops and snares of flesh, banded red, gold and black, large enough to snarl a phaeton. The air boils with sound – a hiss-roar, thunderous and unceasing.

# Last lights

The Cackling Mechanic brays in hysterical amusement at the chaos, producing something small and metallic from within beneath her bandages. Coils close in from all sides – vast reaches of scaled flesh conjoined uneasily with furred segments of tiger, writhing sinuous or propelled by feline paws. The Seventh Coil's awful unvoice shrieks throughout: _you will not hurt him he will join with us he loves us truly and after all this time_—

Just as the coils are about to slam into you, the Mechanic flips on her device. A single bulb, encased within a lead housing, blazes forth, brighter even than its sisters in your great arrays. Wiring sparks in her hands; sigils blaze and flicker on the leaden panels. The Seventh Coil's outer reaches vanish and fade beneath unyielding, rational law, burning all that should not be out of what currently is.

Its coils retract once more to the darkness, looping around the injured Keeper. With the Mechanic at your side, you sprint the final few metres to the great double doors.
