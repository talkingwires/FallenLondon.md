_Dearest consort._ The voice is hardly a voice. You feel it in your body, deep, throaty, sibilant, like a wave crashing against the shore. _Time is nothing. We exist beyond its ragged flame. You will, too._

All around you, a continuous rustling, as of something slithering. The Patient Mastermind flattens against a column of hammered gold. Ahead, an eye moves into the light â€“ vast, emerald, ringed with fur, a serpent's eye in a tiger's socket.

_Escape is_ your _notion._ You push past a pillar-tree of gold-veined marble to see the Tiger Keeper, enthroned beside the enormous eye of the Seventh Coil. Before him, kneeling in strictly regimented rows, a crowd press their forelocks to the silver-veined undergrowth. _We are not trapped. We are contemplative._ A low hiss-roar, and something distant cracks and breaks. _Is our company not enough for you, now that you behold us in the true?_
