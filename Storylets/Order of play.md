"First," Pages says, "you must understand that the Marvellous is not a single game. What a disappointment that would be! No, it is a tournament – a series of contests in which two players face one another. One is knocked from the running; the other advances.

"Beforehand, however, comes the Honour: an initial grande mêlée in which all players compete. Its results determine the order and pairings of the ensuing rounds.

"So the first to drop out plays the second, and so on. Whomsoever wins the Honour defaultomatically advances to the second round of contests.

"But my excitement has mastered me. To begin with, as you so eruditically observe, we need a venue. And cards."
