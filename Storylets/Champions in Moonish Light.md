The ascent through the Labyrinth is riotous and celebratory. First, a sprint through the sixth coil, already beginning to chafe against the bindings of viric. Then an eruption into the fifth, where not even the Striped Officiant's band of tigers can halt the carnival atmosphere. The fourth, the third, the second and the first â€“ none offer obstacles enough to stop the procession.

You accompany victors and sacrifices new and old into London's streets. Tributes lost to the coil for centuries take great lungfuls of fungal air. Alleys echo with voices in all the languages of the Neath.

The Fifth City, robbed without explanation of a grand celebration to cap off the Coilheart Games, needs little incitement to revelry. Spectators, competitors, opportunists and rakes take to the streets. Word spreads. The Games are over. The Coil has opened. And a party to put the Neath to shame is unfurling from within.

# # A collapse of divisions

Here, masked visitors from Visage correspond in unfamiliar tongues with escapees hailing from the prior Fallen Cities. There, Mutton Islanders mingle with the Mandrake's usual boisterous crowds, presenting a bevy of new and filthy songs that are all, theoretically, on the subject of sheep husbandry. Tourists from Codex and Polythreme and the isolated Mangrove Colleges adopt lost Coil escapees into their revels, heedless of language or cultural barriers.

Upon the subject of precisely _what_ you are all celebrating, opinions differ. The story will not settle until later, and few indeed will know the tale whole and entire. But the promise of a grand celebration has hung over the city for long enough that your procession out of the Labyrinth is all the catalyst needed for merriment, like a cork flying from the neck of His Lordship's second best prosecco.
