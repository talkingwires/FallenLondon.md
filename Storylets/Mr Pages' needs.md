Mr Pages has insisted that you shut the monkey in a back-room while it visits. "Distestable creatures," Pages commented. Once this is done, Mr Pages gets down to business.

"The venue must be somewhere that all the players can agree on. I must warn you, they have rareifined tastes. Visit each, listen to their needs, identify a solution that satisfies them, and then arrange it.

"Happily, I am a creature of simple and ordinary tastes. I shall tell you my requirements here and now: I want somewhere new. But somewhere not under the sway of the Fingerkings. Players have attempted to make bargains in the past. It has never ended well."
