Everybody listens closely when the Officiant is on this subject. "If the Tributes remain alive, as you say, then they will be enmeshed. Either within the defences of the prison itself, or tangled in the grasp of the Seventh Coil." He scratches behind his ear. "They say that the Seventh Coil spoke to its old minsters, and filled their minds with silver. Those who rejected him, he robbed of their shapes."

The tiger shudders, a long movement from skull to tail. "We will need a means of cleansing outside influence â€“ the influence of Parabola."

***Your allies, rivals and visitors in London will be able to help in the development of a plan to break the Tributes free of their captivity.***
