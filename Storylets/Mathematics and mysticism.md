story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"
---

Everyone knows that Madame Shoshana is the 'Neath's Foremost Clairvoyante' (Mrs Plenty's promotional budget is second only to her litigious expenses for false advertising). Anyone can walk into the tent behind the House of Mirrors for a perfectly capable tarot reading.

But not just anyone can walk into _this_ parlour.

Amongst the Fifth City's discerning mystics, only one gentleman has a reputation for 'getting it right' with anything resembling consistency, and that gentleman doesn't entertain the public.

"I see patterns," says the Croupier. "The cards are equations. I merely calculate."
