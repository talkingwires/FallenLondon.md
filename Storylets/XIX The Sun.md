Without light, nothing would grow. But even though you're underground, there's no shortage. Vast banks of electric bulbs – thousands, tens of thousands, or perhaps even _hundreds_ of thousands – glow around the garden. Their filaments blaze. They hum with power. Your ears buzz and your eyes burn from the crackling voltage.

Glass shatters. Sparks fly. You move down the banks, smashing bulbs with every blow. The damage? Incalculable. Khaganian technology surpasses almost everything in London, but not without a price. It will take the Khanate months to manufacture enough replacements; and in the meantime, this garden will wither.
