A stark hush, distant howling, things scuttling in the alleys â€“ the sweet strains of the Forgotten Quarter. Mr Wines sits beneath the verdigrised and moss-chewed roof of the Dilapidated Pavilion. It is sampling an array of gem-coloured liqueurs with a veiled and bandaged figure. Another tomb-colonist?

"Ah, you've arrived," Mr Wines slurs. "A saviour to savour in Our hour of need. We could dance a jig. Though not as the dead do."

The Master hiccups. "Not the Totentanz."
