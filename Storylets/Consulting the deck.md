story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"
---

A tree stands in a clearing, branches heavy with golden fruit. There's even more fruit on the ground. It must have fallen down, ripe and ready to eat. An old woman stoops to gather the fallen fruit into a basket. Around the tree, a great serpent coils like a caduceus. Its forked tongue flickers into the woman's ear.
