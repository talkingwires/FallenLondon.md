You're not looking at a goat-demon's reflection. Obviously not. Goat-demons don't have this many eyes. Their eyes aren't encrusted with Attar. Your own eyes aren't encrusted either, and the longer you stare, the more blood doesn't trickle down your cheeks.

Reassure yourself: this isn't happening. Therefore, there's nothing to worry about. You haven't opened a doorway that cannot be closed. You haven't entered a castle that hasn't been built. This isn't where the Discordance is studied, because it cannot be studied.

You aren't welcome here.
