The Great Hellbound Railway does not own the train that steams into the station. Its private compartment is mounted with enough heavy artillery to turn a small town into a crater. Its panels are gold-plated. Its wheels have gold rims studded with rubies. Its passenger does not disembark, but an attendant opens the door and beckons you to step inside.
