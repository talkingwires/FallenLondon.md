Mr Pages has helped itself to a glass of your best wine. "Beautifully picquanted," it says, smacking something under its hood in satisfaction.

"The seventh player? Why, he won! Succeeded! He was triumphious! Having achieved his heart's desire, he has no need to play again. This is protocol: when a player wins, they depart. A new candidate is found, or occasionally, like your delecterious self, presents themselves." Pages lets out a long faux-melancholy sigh. "The rest of us must keep playing, of course. Victory is the only escape."
