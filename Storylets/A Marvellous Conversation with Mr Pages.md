To achieve your heart's desire, you must win the Marvellous. In order to win the Marvellous, you need two things: a suitable deck of cards and a venue adequate to the needs of the players.

Mr Pages has availed itself to you. If you leave a note within a rare book of red vellum in a certain bookshop (that stocks only books of a crimson hue), Mr Pages will appear the next day at your lodgings. It prefers to loom beside your fireplace, and will offer advice. It is keen for the Marvellous to begin again...
