You fill out a great deal of paperwork. You shake hands with one Devil after another. You share the good news with your investors: the Great Hellbound Railway is ready to start laying track! This giddy success is toasted in Airag.

Early the next morning – much earlier than a civilised person should be awake – a woman presents herself at your lodgings. She's wearing overalls, work gloves, and a vast metal helmet, as though she were going on a deep-zee dive.

"Figured I'd do you a favour and come to you," she says, shaking your hand too firmly. "I'm 'Furnace' Ancona, I run the Tracklayers' Union, and if you want to put down any rail out of London, it's me you need to be dealing with. Not those yellow-eyed critters."
