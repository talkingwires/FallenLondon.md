"I was the Chaplain in his father's regiment. A fine man that I was proud to serve beside in the war of '68. Afterâ€”" the Bishop hesitates for a moment, eyes stuck perceiving some scar of the past. "I made it out, he didn't. A whole patrol and I was the only one."

The Bishop's eyes lock on yours. They burn with zeal. "When I arrived back in London, I vowed to the Lord that I would devote my life to protecting those whom my comrades had left behind."

"I try to carry the love and wishes of the Regulator's father with me. I use my connections to give them the best chances, because that's what he would have wanted. I see little wrong with that."
