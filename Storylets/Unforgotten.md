With the Wakeful Eye's blockade of the wide-open passage to the Sixth Coil, the atmosphere in the offices has intensified. Huffam is keeping a lid on the story, by hook and by crook, until he can tell the whole tale at once. He works like a man possessed, his desk an endless parade of reporters, informants, and visiting dignitaries. "We'll get to the bottom of this, mark my words."

More and more outsiders crowd the office. A severe Khaganian speaks to a harangued copywriter, attempting to issue censures and corrections. Some of the braver journalists have collared a few tigers outside, looking for comment. A couple of visitors from the so-called Koloman Republic take their turns in the interview room. Even the Whispering Duellist is here, setting the story straight to a sweating sub-editor, sabre conspicuously visible.
