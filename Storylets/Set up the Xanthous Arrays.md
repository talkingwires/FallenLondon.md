Bulbs; wires; generator. The midnight sounder, connected to its counterpart on your person, will act as the trigger. The machinery looks foreign and unreal in the shifting Coil, before these gleaming cyclopean doors â€“ like an intrusion from an imagined industrial age.

The Cackling Mechanic checks and rechecks the wiring, glancing nervously at the dark beyond the doors. The Bohemian Sculptress's voice is low and calm. "It will work."

There's no opportunity to test the array in situ. Once it's on, all hell will break loose. You'll have to trust.

The Weeping Mercenary nods in your direction. "I'm turning this on. Finger on the button. Remember: lights on as soon as you let go." A pause. "Don't get us all trapped." You place your thumb on the single button of the midnight sounder as the generators begin to hum. One by one, you enter the Seventh Coil's cell.
