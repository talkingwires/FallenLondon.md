The Efficient Commissioner gives you an acutely amused look. "That's why I am here now. You're not easy to pin down. Catching you at the GHR meeting was the safest bet. But you can imagine how irritated I was when weeks of investigation revealed you had the Seed."

"Enfrustracious," volunteers Mr Pages. Sympathy? From a Master? Or simply a statement of fact?

"Weeks," says the Efficient Commissioner. "I interviewed a thief specialising in botanical heists. I pursued a dirigible pilot to the roof of the Neath. I disguised myself as one of the Starved Men. And you had the d----d thing all along."
