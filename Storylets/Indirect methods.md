For a moment it seems as though the panther might ignore the laws that name humans as his wards, and leap at you both, duty be damned. Then he lifts his paw, slow and reluctant. "The enemy can be subtle, even in their weakness. But so be it. The beast is your responsibility. The puzzle of its presence here is yours to solve." He disappears into the undergrowth with an angry swish of the tail. Do you hear his stomach rumble as he stalks away?

The little rat stands, dusts herself off, and pouts in the panther's direction. "Thank you for standing up for me! It would have been tremendously embarrassing to fail in my quest so close to the starting line." Her whiskers twitch nervously. "This is all proving rather harder than I'd hoped."
