  - "[[Of Stripes, and Coils]]"

The light is dim, a dance of shadows and glittering reflections. A forest without trees; a treasury of undergrowth. Silver columns, hung with vines of gold. Ferns of faceted emerald. Carmine berries. Eyes and bodies, moving beneath the dark.

Words from the deep shadows halt your approach. "Please â€“ my lord. My love." The Tiger Keeper's throaty voice is plaintive. "We must go. Your court takes too long to gather, and our time is short."

You stay low. The words are not for you. Something vast shifts in the deep, jewelled jungle. Eyes like glim-lamps roam.
