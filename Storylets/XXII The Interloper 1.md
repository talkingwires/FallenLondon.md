Gaze upon yourself. You are the Interloper in this tarot reading. Some years from now (never mind how many), you will infiltrate the Khanate to investigate the Year of the Serpent. Who knows? Perhaps you'll even sample a bottle. Many motives may inspire you, but one will guide you like the brightest false-star in the sky.

# Motivated

"The Museum of Prelapsarian History can post as many 'Do Not Touch' signs as they want," says the Thirsty Croupier. "The exhibits will always have finger-prints."

He adds The Interloper to the spread.

"Whatever drives you, we're all driven. Motivation _itself_ is inescapable. That's just mathematics. Cause and effect. Action; reaction. Call it whatever you will, but we can't wiggle out. Not completely. Every tomorrow follows today. Today is what permits every tomorrow to exist. Even the most liberated tomorrow, if you catch my meaning. It's all right here in the cards." He shrugs. "Unless I'm wrong, of course."

# "Picture it."
Reflected lights glimmer in the Thirsty Croupier's glass. Reflected lights glimmer in the Moon Canal: glass bulbs, thousands, strung above the water, their electric constellations flickering from the Nephrite Quarter to the Imperial Colleges.

"You're there," says the Thirsty Croupier. "The Year of the Serpent is ready to drink, and the Khanate is ready to imbibe. The Queen of Cups has struck a deal, but the Knight of Swords is a thorn in her side. He knows these canals. He leads you to the source: where the Serpent is cultivated."
