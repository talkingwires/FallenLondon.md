"Someone's taking defensive measures. Someone _else_ is trying to break through," says the Thirsty Croupier. "The Interloper is already inside, but there are always more layers. More locks to pick and more doors to open. They might be psychological. They might be physical. These barriers are deep-rooted. They run to the garden's heart."

# Exploiting an opening

It's underground. It's in the walls. It's everywhere! Is this gardener just a gigantic intestinal tract? An intestinal tract with a little straw hat?

You slip and dodge through loops and tubes. Digestive organs squirm in the soil, chained together by pulsing muscles. The Sacristan raises a spade, drives it down â€“ and hits a pitchfork. You've raided the gardening shed. You repel the attack.

"Impressive footwork," says the Thirsty Croupier.
