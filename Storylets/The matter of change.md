The substances you have at hand are not all alike. None of them are classifiable, of course; they are wholly unrelated to blood, bile, or those other fluids known to modern medicine. They seem to perform different functions within the body of the Starved Citadels, and perhaps also within the bodies of the Starved Men themselves. They must be secreted by specialised organs, for varied purposes.

One liquid is tremendously flammable – a propellant that might very well be used for some form of propulsion. Another seems analogous to amber; indeed, it reacts to amber. It may be a carrier for the same 'vital essences' the Rubbery Men concern themselves with. Several of the vials you tested are deathly toxic, of course.

Examining these samples is only a sideways glimpse at the transformative practices of the Starved Men, but it is revealing. It is obvious they use amber, but there are other facilitating substances that you can't immediately identify. Their approach to the Shapeling Arts seems to have evolved divergently from the Rubbery Men, towards a syncretic approach that embraces different ways of transforming the body – including the judicious use of unusual drugs and poisons.
