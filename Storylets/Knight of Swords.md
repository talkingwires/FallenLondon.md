  - "[[Arcana]]"

The knight in the picture is slaying a many-headed dragon. An odd piece of artwork for the Parlour of Virtue to hang in the Velvet Boudoir, but the Khaganian Ambassador studies the brushstrokes with admiration. He always reserves this room for 'off the books' liaisons. Tonight, he's here for business, not pleasure. It wasn't easy to buttonhole him, but you pulled the right strings and said the right things. What did you discuss?

# Securing an ally
If the College of Mortality is anything, it is a monopoly â€“ or an _aspirational_ monopoly. Any competition in the market for eternal life would be ill-met indeed

The Khaganian Ambassador swirls cognac, lounging beneath _St George and the Parlous Knot_, and listens with a growing grin to the scheme you propose. He might work for the Khanate; the Khanate might value the Gracious Widow's brewing expertise; but the Widow has done nothing to win the Ambassador's respect.

"Leave it to me," he says. "I'll get you in."

The Thirsty Croupier slides him across the table, placing the Knight of Swords into the spread. You're back in the townhouse. Did you ever leave? But you were just in the Velvet Boudoir!

"You _will_ be," corrects the Croupier. "This cider has a kick, eh?"
