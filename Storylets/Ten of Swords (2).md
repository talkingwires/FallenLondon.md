How many needles were plunged into this creature's skin? How much ink was required to tattoo these sigils? Hypnotic glyphs cover its body. Their meanings burn in your mind: _I am eternal, and yet my reign is circumscribâ€™d by Law and Fate._ The gardener twists, uprooting more coils from the earth. Coils speared with countless blades.

# Caged and constrained

"This gardener has been twice-tamed," says the Thirsty Croupier. "First by the College of Mortality in Nidah, and then by the Great Khan's forces in the Fourth City. His warriors battled the beast. They drove ten-thousand swords into its back. His priests shackled and bent its mind to serve the Great Khan's court. Its body is still riddled with their blades. Its throat is still pinched by an iron collar. It lives in constant agony, obedient to its new master."
