You're locked in a mental exchange with a fishmonger from Spite. You're just about done unravelling one another's entire complex of anxieties and fears. You suddenly wake up.

At some point you must have collapsed to the floor; you're lying on your back, staring at the domed ceiling of the spire chamber. "Is it done?" you hear one of the Masters asking. "Did it work?"

Fires glances at you, then out through the window at London. "It must have," it says. "Nothing appears to be on fire, and we're all still alive."

The chamber soon empties of Masters, and you are left to descend, alone, back to the streets of London.
