There are hints of the building's former grandeur. There is a large fireplace, but it is empty. There are no tables or seats in this room, but the odd ornate cushion has been left on the floor. A merry tapestry is still hanging â€“ it depicts a bevy of nuns and an outraged bishop who, on closer inspection, doesn't appear as outraged as one might expect. The zee air has not been kind to any of the furnishings.
