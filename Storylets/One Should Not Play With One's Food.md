"Glasswalker. Why do you disturb me about my duty?" The panther's voice rasps, impatient. Beneath his paw, the little rat scrabbles against the grass. "It is given unto us to protect these lands from interlopers."

The rat squeaks, finding room to breathe beneath the panther's vast toe-pads. "I'm not an interloper! I'm a rat! And I'm on a very important quest!" She wriggles again, and the panther's claws flex around her. Is she wearing a doublet?
