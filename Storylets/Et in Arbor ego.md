You need: somewhere new, non-ecclesiastic, not too associated with any one player, sweet-smelling, and not under the sway of Fingerkings nor near the Zee.

You write a very long list, and begin crossing off options â€“ until eventually you hit upon the only possible candidate: Arbor, the City of the Roses. A city mired in dream on the Elder Continent, half-in and half-out of Parabola, walled against the Fingerkings and ruled by a Roseate Queen with a perfumed fist.

Of course, you'll need to get permission. For that you'll need to travel to Arbor and speak with the Queen herself. Gifts will be required: it's said she favours tales of old mysteries and magnificent diamonds.

**You can travel to Arbor via a card in your Opportunity Deck titled 'A Dream of Roses'. You will need 3 Magnificent Diamonds, 1 Primaeval Hint and high Attar.**
