f these plants are cultivated, what must wilderness entail? The Khagan's secret garden is more vine-strangled than a jungle, more humid than a hothouse, and more treacherous than the Tiger Keeper's fighting-pits. Sealed since the Fourth City, attendants rarely visit without losing a hand to the snapping fly-traps. Ripe fruit hangs just within reach.

# Salting the earth

The plants protest. You don't listen. Not even when they plead in half-human language. Orchids with stamens like tongues splutter: "Puh-puh-puh-lease..." Vines writhe. Roses weep. Your poison seeps into their roots, drop by flesh-eating drop.

You empty vials of ammonia. You douse flowerbeds with acid. You turn out your pockets, producing flasks and snuffboxes and little glass bottles with atomisers. You spritz death and sprinkle powdered oblivion.
