"Taken. From me. By you," growls a voice from inside the carriage. "And now you bring it back. For what?" You can see fangs glimmer in the dark: more rows than a shark's mouth could hold. "For payment. What everyone wants. Nothing lacks a price. Including theft."

Behind you, the carriage door slams. You feel the train begin to move. Mr Stones strikes a match on an emerald tooth, lights a foxfire candle.

"Sit down. We'll discuss _payment_."

You ride along the line for several hours. Apparently, the Master _does_ intend to pay you, but the transaction demands interminable paperwork. Your signature is required here. And here. And in approximately ten thousand other places. Every now and again, Mr Stones lifts a tiny jewellery-loupe to scrutinise the fine print. Finally, you are presented with your reward, just in time for the carriage to pull back into the station at the Hurlers. But when an attendant opens the door, it isn't for you to disembark.

Mr Stones unhinges its jaws â€“ and the bloody teeth that climb into the carriage proceed to climb into those jaws, re-inserting themselves into the Master's gums. "Obedient," says Mr Stones. "Unlike others. Expose more weak points in security, and you'll be rewarded again."

The Calculating Lapidary isn't at her post when you return. You keep finding her in other places, however. The trading post isn't there anymore either, except for some well-gnawed debris.
