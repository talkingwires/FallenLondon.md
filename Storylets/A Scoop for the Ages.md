Huffam's hordes of reporters have scoured London for the winners of the Coilheart Games, bringing them – by hook or by crook – to stand before him in his office. The Bohemian Sculptress. The Cackling Mechanic. The Weeping Mercenary. Tigers are conspicuously, if unsurprisingly, absent.

These newcomers join the rest of Huffam's swollen and impromptu news team of visiting dignitaries, sapphire-clad urchins, noisy tomb-colonists and turncoat spies. The old editor stands now before the quiescent press, his face solemn.

"Through our combined efforts, we have uncovered the unhappy truth of the Sixth Coil. It is only proper that all of you should now know the truth." Huffam hands out a run of newspapers, fresh from the press behind him.
