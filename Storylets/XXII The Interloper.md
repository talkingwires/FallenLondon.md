On the Surface, the traditional tarot may contain twenty-two major arcana, but symbols proliferate like mushrooms in the Neath; decks down here feature seventy-seven.

The Interloper is climbing a ladder below an open window. Whether up or down, well, that depends on which direction the card falls. Either way, the Interloper's back – _your_ back – is burdened by a sack loaded with golden coins and silver goblets. The rungs on the ladder are blades, which don't appear to make the climb much easier.

Scrawled on the reverse side, there's a note: _Found you in a reading. You'll want to hear about this._ There's also an address on Ladybones Road. Quite a respectable address.
