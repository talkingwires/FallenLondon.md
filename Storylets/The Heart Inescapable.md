The double doors are vast, towering out of the Coil like a transplant from an ancient temple. They are gold and jewelled, inlaid with motifs of the deep jungle. Vines hung with serpents, and prowling cats, eyes in ruby and emerald.

They are also wide, wide open. The Keeper's voice sounds within; you are not too late. These doors will be your last redoubt: sealed behind you, once all the Tributes are out.
