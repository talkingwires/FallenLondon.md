You walk in the tigers' shadows, close enough to hear strained growls burble from constricted throats, close enough to see that the silver in their gaze is flecked and unsteady. One with a broken fang manages a roar, and her eyes clear completely – to lock eyes directly with the Cackling Mechanic. Slowly, slowly, the Cackling Mechanic raises finger to lip. The tiger's eyes widen – she shakes herself, to keep her body free of influence.

_Is, and Not, and always, and never. We will become you as once we became each other._ The Seventh Coil and the Tiger Keeper barely look away from each other, the Keeper entranced atop his throne, and the Coil hauling ever more of its body out from the shadows.
