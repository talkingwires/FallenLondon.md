Did the Rattus faber dream, before they were awakened with speech? Surely, somewhere, far from human dreaming. Perhaps their voiceless cousins linger still, dreaming of the Swarm in the tangled dreams of beasts.

But these close-packed tunnels resonate differently to Parabola's jungles, where human dreamers walk in light and safety. In contrast, the Whisker-Ways seem newer, more recent; an afterthought crammed in the cracks of an already-brimming country.

There are whispers of a place where Shapelings dream, deep and hidden from the light of Parabola. Perhaps a parallel might be drawn. Have these places – these sequestered havens for similar minds – always existed, merely to be discovered and claimed by the first ratty and Rubbery dreamers? Or did the dreamers themselves invent them out of dire necessity, upon first encountering a Parabola hostile to their manner of dreaming?
