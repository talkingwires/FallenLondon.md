Most of your effort goes to pushing to hold a vote at all. Furnace's supporters are numerous, and they have not forgotten her. Some are gruff old tracklayers in uniform and helmet. Some are younger. When she stands to speak, the crowd of listeners contains two girls who have painted their faces in Furnace's honour, drawing an extra mouth on each cheek.

"Waste of lip paint," remarks Furnace in your ear.

Her speech is bracing, a reminder of why the Union should retain its allegiance to the person who led them so far. "We have not yet reached the hardest part of our journey," she says. "We have reached Moulin, it's true. What is next? The Hurlers. Some of you know what happened to me there. Few of you have seen it." A hush falls on the crowd. Furnace reaches up and pulls at the straps of her helmet. In utter silence, she lifts it away.

"What lies ahead of us is Discordance territory," says Furnace. From her Liberationist mouth, she adds, "Our best chance at darkness." And her third mouth adds, "Our greatest opportunity to alter the Chain."

After that, the vote is not even close.

Afterwards, you see the sparkle of something like a tear on her cheek. Probably cried by her Prehistoricist eyes, given the placement. When she catches you looking, she snaps the visor shut.
