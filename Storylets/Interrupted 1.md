"So you'll destroy the Year of the Serpent, huh? Without even taking a sip?" asks the Thirsty Croupier. "I guess you could still lick the puddles. Wait. Never mind. You couldn't."

He lays down another card.

"You won't have time. You won't be alone. Someone will catch you. Someone who lives in the garden. The Khagan doesn't post guards because there's no need. Not just because the gate is sealed â€“ although that's a factor. Without the Ambassador's help, you'll never open it. No, the Khagan doesn't post guards because the gardener is dangerous enough."
