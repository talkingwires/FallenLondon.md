Doña Villar is playing roulette with her guests at a wheel in the garden's centre. A Noted Orchid-Grower is admiring the lettuce beside the path, while an Indebted Spirifer is bemoaning his bad luck at the last spin. You can hear music drift from a balcony high overhead.

"Next to slug-racing, roulette is my greatest passion," says Doña Villar. "Probably my tenth or fifteenth greatest, anyway. Maybe my fortieth."
