"A gage is a pledge of good faith," says the Efficient Commissioner. "Something akin to a bail, to be returned safe to its original owner if all ends well. It was measured against the souls in the Neath because it was meant to represent the promise that the Bazaar would prevent its people from causing too much damage. Therefore, one gage per person."
