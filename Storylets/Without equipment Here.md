Your laboratory is full of things that would help; you have access to none of them. But between your own pockets and the provisions of your compatriots, you do have a clock (which ticks steadily in its presence) and ordinary lamplight (which gleams back unchanged) and a handful of moon-pearls (which do nothing, of course, as one would expect).

No. Not nothing. After you set them on the table, they roll gently towards the stone and lie against its surface like puppies nestling at their mother's side. They shine as though the moon were full, although it is currently waning.

Mr Spices and Mr Pages say nothing. Mr Iron stares at your experiment as though it had learned something unimaginable. It takes from the folds of its robe a mirrorcatch box, and without explanation or ceremony, shines pure sunlight on the Creditorial stone.

What comes back is not sunlight. For the briefest moment, everyone in the room appears other than human, their bodies boulders and trees and false-stars, and then the image fades.
