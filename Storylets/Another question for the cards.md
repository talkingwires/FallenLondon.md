  - "[[Arcana]]"

"Most airag needs less than a week," says the Thirsty Croupier. "Wait too long and it spoils. The cheap stuff, freshly produced in the Khanate today? Infinitely better than old bottles from the Fourth City. But people don't value the Year of the Tortoise for its delightful flavour. The Serpent might taste even worse â€“ _if_ it's airag. The fact that it needs centuries to ferment would suggest otherwise. Who made it? With what? How?"

He shuffles the cards again. "Shall we find out?"

***During this Exceptional Story, the Thirsty Croupier will deal tarot cards directly into your Opportunity Deck. Play the cards to advance the story.***
