With golden shears, the gardener prunes a branch. With a golden spade, the gardener digs little holes and sprinkles seeds inside. Plucking fruit with its gloved hands (if one could call them hands), the gardener deposits the fruit into a wicker basket, which it carries with the handle hooked over an elbow (or something jointed like an elbow).

# Endless labour

"Nidah sits on the Mountain of Light," says the Thirsty Croupier. "At the Mountain's heart, the Garden grows. But gardens aren't jungles. They need gardeners. Wilderness versus cultivation: _that's_ the distinction. And the Garden requires a very particular type of gardener. One who can manage eternally-blooming plants. One who can tolerate direct exposure to the Mountain's divinity. One who was _born_ in the light. The Khagan's garden isn't the Garden, but the Great Khan brought seeds from the Elder Continent. Only the Sacristan can tend to them."
