Long ago, in Veilgarden, you first heard of the Marvellous: a card game whose prize was the winner's heart's desire. The game was only played rarely, during obscure astrological conjunctions. However, if all the players agreed, the Marvellous could convene early. You also discovered that there were currently six players, among them a cardsharp monkey.

Rekindling the monkey's desire to play, he pointed you to another player, the Bishop of St Fiacre's. The Bishop informed you of two more – the Manager of the Royal Bethlehem and the Topsy King. He also told you of the initial stake: 77 First City coins.

The Topsy King had no desire to play again. In an effort to convince him, you uncovered his past: he was Tristram Bagley, who had once tried to compose an impossible opera played on glass instruments. His sister, Cora Bagley, who clearly had some connection with your cardsharp monkey, told you that Tristram had gambled his mind away during the Marvellous as a final, desperate stake. If some of the opera could be performed, he might remember something of himself.

Staging a performance of the opera, you temporarily restored Tristram's mind. He agreed to play the Marvellous, and told you that the Manager had bluffed him into losing his mind.

The Manager was your next target. He would play, on the condition that you travelled to the living city of Polythreme and released him from his oath to its King of a Hundred Hearts. The King and the Manager had been lovers in the days of the First City, but were now estranged. You won the King around by returning a shard of its heart that had been stolen by urchins. Before he agreed to release his once-lover from his oath, though, the King asked you to ensure that the Manager did not win the Marvellous.

Next, you approached the fifth player, the deviless Virginia. She claimed she wanted for nothing, and so had no reason to reconvene the Marvellous early. If she had no heart's desire, you decided you would provide one for her. When she learned that her oldest enemy, an imprisoned Prince of Hell, had been freed, she was compelled to rejoin.

That left only the final player, Mr Pages. You devised an elaborate scheme, a grand treason against all that the Masters hold dear – in order to convince Pages to play. But you had only set to work on the earliest phase of your plan when Mr Pages approached you and begged you to play the Marvellous.

Why is the old devil so keen for the game to begin again? You don't know, but it has informed you what is needed for the game to begin: a deck, and a venue.
