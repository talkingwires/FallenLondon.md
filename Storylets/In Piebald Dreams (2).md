The Piebald Dreamer draws herself up tall, spilling loose leaves of paper from her notebook as she does so. "The rats of London are forgetting our old stories. Our myths. The things that made us what we are." She adjusts her doublet, preening. "If I find the Chroniclers and rescue them, we'll have to remember. They'll all have to care about stories again."

> Parabola contains endless mysteries. But if the Dreamer is in search of a myth, you hope she has a little more information to work with.
