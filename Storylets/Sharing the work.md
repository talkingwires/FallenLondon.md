"This is a large building, and it'll take me some time to check every room. The mask could be here." Virginia cuts open a cushion and places its stuffing in the fireplace. "There's no point in my being cold while I work. I'm against unnecessary suffering. Particularly my own."

She considers you for a long moment. "This won't take two people. I'll look here, and if you find the mask elsewhere, bring it to me. I would be terribly grateful." She leads you to the path back to the main Festival and sends you on your way with an over-cheerful: "On you get!"
