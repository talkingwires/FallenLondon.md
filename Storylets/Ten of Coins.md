story:
  - "[[Arcana]]"

Ages ago, when the trees were saplings, the True Khan himself sat in this garden. His astrologers and advisers surrounded him. His loyal hounds lay at his feet. His predecessor's daughter knelt, and took his hand, and begged a boon. The gardener, shackled and staked to the ground, would provide every resource for her greatest recipe.

"Today, the Gracious Widow is _persona non grata_ in many Khaganian households," says the Thirsty Croupier. "But her bargain with the Leopard Khan dates from an ancient pact: her knowledge; his garden; _their_ airag. As an investment, it might have soured. It didn't. Year after year, the Sacristan has toiled; and year after year, the garden has grown. So has its value. It's worth a fortune. The Stone Pigs can stir. The Sixth City can fall. Locked away like money in a vault, this garden is the Leopard Clan's insurance policy â€“ and the Widow's leverage."
