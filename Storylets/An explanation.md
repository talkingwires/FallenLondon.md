"A party for the ages, an ancient obligation," Mr Wines says. "We agreed to it long ago. Once in the course of a Fallen city, We offer a chance to die. Truly die, as one would above. Some tomb-colonists crave the Totentanz. It's why they've shown up in droves with their... expectations."

Mr Wines drains its glass. "It is no easy thing, but the time has come. And We find Ourselves in need of some assistance. Your name came up."
