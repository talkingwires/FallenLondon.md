The Year of the Serpent is here. Unguarded bottles line racks on the walls for anyone to stroll right up to and drink. But these bottles aren't ancient and covered in dust, as one might expect from a vintage so old. In fact, the corks appear freshly stoppered. Has this 'airag' really been fermenting since the Fourth City?

# Shattered

Is the Year of the Serpent _actually_ distilled from mare's milk? Well, it has a similar consistency when you smash the bottles.

Great pools spread over the ground â€“ pale, creamy, speckled with ceramic shards. And there's an alcoholic tang to the vapour that escapes.

There's also a sweetness like fruit or honey.

Airag never smells like _this_. It's not usually tinged with gold either. Sparkling dregs float and swirl in the puddles. Your head swims; even the fumes are intoxicating. But you maintain your focus. You move to the next rack. One by one, you break every bottle.
