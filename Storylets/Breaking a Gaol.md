---

A makeshift laboratory and war-room has been set up in the depths of the Labyrinth, in view of the Sixth Coil's great and yawning doors. Here, tigers, busybodies, Coilheart victors and visitors from across the Neath collaborate on the problems of the labyrinth. Amongst a war of priorities – rescues, explorations, thefts and seals – a plan slowly forms.

Every so often a familiar face will emerge from beyond the doors to the Sixth Coil, blinking. Most will not talk about what they find in there, beyond the barest details necessary to further your knowledge.
