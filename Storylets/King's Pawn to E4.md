"The Knight," you whisper. They nod, and present you with an envelope from Vienna. Inside is a single instruction.

There's a chessboard in your Lodgings. You'll send your response. Your opponent will send his own. The address from which it comes will never be the same, but it will always be in Vienna.

The game is fierce and old. And now you play with its master. The pawns you sacrifice will never be – and never were – just pawns.
