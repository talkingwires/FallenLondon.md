There is an Admiral Jack-in-the-box amongst the profusion of clockwork toys. The Drowned Daughter studies it, then studies you. Like a portraitist choosing her brushes, she selects a worm gear for steady work; moon-pearls for nautical time-keeping; a disc indented with the pattern of a shanty-tune...

The three of you sit all night at the riverbank. You are the only one who feels the cold. By morning, your [[Admiral-in-a-Box]] is ready. Every time you turn the crank and his head pops out of the box, you see a figure of respectability and social approval, and are subtly reminded of yourself.
