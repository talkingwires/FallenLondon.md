  - "[[Arcana]]"

"From the Garden, life emerged â€“ and death. But the Dilmun Club is concerned with life. Everlasting life, to be precise. Across the Elder Continent, beyond the Bleeding Forest and the Desert of Delights, there's a seven-walled city: Nidah. The Presbyterate rules the Continent, and Nidah rules the Presbyterate. Guarded by Nidah's seven walls, the ancient Garden still flourishes. Access is prohibited, of course. We can't have everyone eating forbidden fruit, can we?"

The Thirsty Croupier continues to shuffle.
