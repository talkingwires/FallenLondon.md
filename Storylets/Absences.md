"Mr Cups has locked itself in its tower," growls Wines. "Neither it nor Mr Stones will cooperate with our scheme to protect London."

"Mr Hearts is busy with the work below, in the depths of the Bazaar," claims Apples. "It is rather important work, and Mr Hearts must not be disturbed."

And Mr Mirrors? "Ah, well, you just missed Mirrors," says Wines. "Indeed, Mirrors was here just before you arrived," adds Apples.
