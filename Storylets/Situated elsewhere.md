The location in a lonely corner of Mutton Island did this school no favours. The one Jenny set up in Ladybones Road positively thrives, or so you hear. Certainly, most of those who attend are seemingly set up for life. Many have entered careers that benefit London, in one fashion or another. They have been seen collecting for charity and protecting the hides and reputations of clientele of the Parlour of Virtue.

If Virginia is unimpressed by that, then she must consider the quality of pupil Jenny has to work with â€“ anarchists, bohemians, nuns, even urchins (being washed and well-presented does not cause them to cease being urchins). It takes great skill and a strong will to forge change in such renegades.
