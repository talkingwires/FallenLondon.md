"With your activities, you mean. Don't worry. Schemes aren't my style. I prefer to sit back and watch. Leave the _grand plan_ to other members. But if they want help, I provide. Ledgers, for example? Liabilities. I keep the club's accounts right here." He taps his skull with a finger. "I'm good with numbers. Statistics. Odds."

"_Betting_ odds," says the False Prophet. "He's a glorified bookie."

"The Dilmun Club likes to gamble. Someone needs to weigh the risk," the Croupier replies. "If the stakes are high, they consult me â€“ and I consult the cards."
