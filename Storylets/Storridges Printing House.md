Storridges is a venerable publishing house on a fashionable street just off the Bazaar. It conducts its business as though the sun never set on the Empire, supplying the same clients as it did before the Fall: frightened aristocrats hiding away in shuttered manses on the edge of London.

Storridges publish a range of esoteric travelogues and saccharine children's stories to a disinterested public. Nowadays, its publishing wing is supported by the more lucrative production of playing cards, churned out in the dismal belly of their factory.
