"Chaos. Warfare. A pitched battle," says the Thirsty Croupier. "Between the Interloper and the Page of Cups, presumably. But the Knight of Swords might be involved – and all the king's horses, so to speak. Not many horses in the Khanate. They've got water-taxis. They've also got lots and _lots_ of mounted artillery."


> [!choice] Throw yourself into the fray
> If someone wants to start a fight, you know how to finish it.

# On the offensive

The gardener's head roves left and right. It sniffs. Its eyes are gone, sockets skewered by twin sabres, but it could smell a butterfly ten leagues away – and it smells you.

More swords rise from the soil – ancient, rust-eaten, impaled in the creature's body. They clatter and clash as the gardener thrashes, whipping its coils around you on every side.

You dance through the blades. You duck, leap, and dodge. You parry a scimitar with a shovel.

# On the offensive (2)

Cracking pillars. Falling bricks. Smoke. Fire. Demolition. Blue Priests scream and White-and-Gold soldiers draw swords. One of the Shrines of Deep Blue Heaven is now a sinkhole in Khan's Glory. The gates of the garden hang on exploded hinges.

_Someone_ must have planted a bomb.

"You?" asks the Thirsty Croupier. "Or her?"

From a vantage point high atop the Hummingbird Tower, the Khaganian Ambassador's mistress watches the sinkhole through a spyglass. She watches _you_ scramble in the rubble.

# On the offensive (3)

Exploratory vines slither through the debris, branching toward the canals. They won't survive long. Not without sufficient light – and not with soldiers hacking them to bits. But they'll have plenty of time to strangle the _Sunday Service_. Orchids will bloom along the wharves. The Moon Canal will run red, and the Leopard Khan will issue a command.

All the guns in Khan's Glory will swivel on their posts.

"Boom," says the Thirsty Croupier. He lays down another card.
