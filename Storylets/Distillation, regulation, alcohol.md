  - "[[Arcana]]"

"The Ace of Staves and Temperance form a potent pair. If you can't make the trek to the Garden, do the next best thing: visit Nikolas Pawnbrokers at the Bazaar. And if you can't afford one of their famous firkins, consider peach brandy â€“ or _apricot_ brandy. Still too expensive? There's more. Let the snake slither into the tortoise's place. Uncork a bottle of airag from the Year of the Serpent, and take a sip of immortality."

The Thirsty Croupier takes a sip from his own glass.

"One hitch: the Year of the Serpent is still fermenting. Even after centuries, it needs more time. But I cheated. I peeked at the future. The balance of power will shift when that drink is mature. Guess who's going to get caught in the political maelstrom?"

He lays down another card. This one is familiar.
