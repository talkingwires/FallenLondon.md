It takes the city by storm, chapters published every other day in an unremarkable rag. The publication is notable primarily for having absolutely no ties at all to _The Unexpurgated London Gazette_, and the novel is released without attribution or by-line. Just _The Maze of Coiled Hearts_, authorless and incendiary.

The bound volumes arrive on your doorstep one morning soon after. It's a custom job – the set contains chapters yet to be published to the reading public. There is no signature. You read ahead, comparing story with memory, overlaying one on top of the other. Were the mysteries this grand, the heroism so pronounced? Or is the antidote to revisionism not truth, but equal and opposite counter-revisionism?

Outside, the lights and sounds of London play out their typical dramas. A few more ships set zail from Wolfstack. More visitors and rescued Tributes leave, or melt into the shadows of the Fifth City until they're no longer visitors at all. After the light and clamour of the Coilheart Games, it looks almost as if nothing has changed.

It is not true. Secrets have been illuminated that have lived in darkness for the lifetimes of fallen cities. Through determination, and community, and sheer bl__dy-mindedness, the Neath uncovered the hidden histories behind the tigers' games – and helped address the tragedies obscured there.

You place the volumes on your shelf, perhaps the only complete record of the Coilheart Games that London will ever know. A reminder – all secrets can be known.

**This concludes the Coilheart Games, and the opening of the Sixth Coil.**
