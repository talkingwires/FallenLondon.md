What is immortality? Merely the Boatman's mercy. Even those with cider in their blood might find themselves floating down a dark river on a slow boat. They must hope the Boatman will honour his promise to steer away from the Far Shore. But if he should misplace his little black book? If his oars prove weaker than the undertow?

# After the explosion

Something convulses violently against your chest. You stagger, as if a horse has kicked you. Your heart thuds. Your blood pulses; your wounds sting; but you don't get a chance to test the Boatman's loyalty to his Schedule.

With a surge of energy, you sit up again in the rubble.

You're surrounded by broken bottles and smashed light-bulbs. The Khaganian Ambassador's amulet crumbles in your grip. The Sacristan, pinned beneath the collapsed Blue Heaven, fumbles for a spade. It starts to clumsily shovel cracked turquoise tiles.

"Maybe to free itself?" asks the Croupier. "Maybe just to clean up the mess. It's still bound in service â€“ but you might change that."
