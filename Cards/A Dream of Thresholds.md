You have never been closer. Your mind burns with the promises of your love â€“ feverish, overflowing, flickering across your skin like a thousand tinder-sparks. The ice is all that stands between you. A wall of it, taller than sky and deeper than sleep.

# Melt it
Press your burning self against it and _walk_.

-----

# A way in


You burn. Your whiskers catch alight. Ice hisses, sublimating to steam before you. From the other side, the way would be impassable. But neither old ally nor enemy expected anybody to attempt to walk in. Even so, it is difficult. If you loved less fiercely, the ice would wall you out. If you watched less fiercely, the fires would burn the mind right out of your body.

You push through the ice, following the light of your love. Your path curls inward. A spiral. A coil.
