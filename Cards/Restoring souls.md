[[An evening of sober celebration|A true and dedicated shepherd of souls]]

Your exploits are honoured with a magnificent meal in a private room at Murgatroyd's. Your health is toasted – in plain water, of course, but the toasts are heartfelt. The Surface food – real apples! an actual goose! – has a marvellously restorative effect on your health. The Messenger takes you aside as cheese is served. "We understand that your work can be difficult, and that you may attract legal attention. Be of good cheer. Our contacts have assured us that your sins are forgiven."
