Special Constables surround you on the street. They are polite but insistent. What they insist is that you come with them to the Bazaar. You get the sense that they wouldn't be polite if you refused, which calls into question whether they're being polite to begin with. Outside the Paper Door, they stop. They've been instructed to ensure you enter alone.


> [!choice] Enter the Paper Door
> Normally, this door would be as impenetrable as a neglected textbook ten minutes before an examination, but today it flutters. You can slip through the pages.

# Changeable chambers

Every wall is covered with paper. All the ceilings, all the floors, are plastered with notes, letters, envelopes postmarked from just around the corner and from halfway around the world. Their pages turn to reveal passages. No passage is ever the same, because each reader understands each passage differently.

Finally, you step through a rippling wall into a room that extends, and extends. Filing cabinets stretch for miles. Mail teeters around you in mountains.

# In the Seventh Sorting Hall

On a table nearby, you can see a letter penned by the Calculating Lapidary. But she hasn't written to Mr Stones. The Master you find waiting for you, completely alone, in this chamber whose triple-tomed walls would absorb the most piercing shriek, is dressed in robes without a single gemstone or sequin. And yet each fibre in those robes is worth more than a manor.

# Dressed to kill

"And now," says Mr Veils, raising a claw, "for the needle."

Its claw is the needle, and its fangs punch holes for the stitches. What it shreds apart, what it threads back together, is more than what you've surrendered, and less. Blood runs down the paper walls. Below your feet, the ground is sopping, scarlet, moist with murderous intent.

At last, Mr Veils bites a lingering string, and you perceive the pattern. It is a pattern so old, so well-worn, so threadbare that it frays before your eyes. The Master throws it over one hunched shoulder like a shawl, and it settles atop another, another, layers and layers obscuring the body below, until there is nobody with you at all.
