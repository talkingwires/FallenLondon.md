Redirected from [[Corresponding Ocelot]]'s card

Mr Huffam gives your letter prominence, and even offers a few supporting comments in an editorial. Replies flood in to the Gazette, commending your Ocelot's views as 'no-nonsense', 'copper-bottomed' and 'savagely rearward-looking'. You receive invitations to a number of political salons. The response heartens your Ocelot: his temper and condition improve immediately. His dinner conversation, however, becomes a little patronising: as if he regards you as more amanuensis than owner. Feline arrogance!
