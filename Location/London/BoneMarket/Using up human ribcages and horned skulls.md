Now that fossilised apes are officially dead, a lot of people have been asking what to do with their leftover parts. I did a lot of math on the subject, and this is what I found:

1 human ribcage
1 horned skull
2 terror bird wings
2 crustacean pincers

This is a chimera which will have either 3 or 6 implausibility, and should be sold to the Author of Gothic Tales during menace weeks. It has 3 antiquity and 6 menace.

If you are grinding all parts from scratch, it is 9.81 SPA at 15 mithridacy, and 9.31 SPA at 10 mithridacy, with 1.18 echoes of extra profit per skeleton.

If you are grinding everything but skulls from scratch, it is 10.83 SPA at 15 mithridacy, and 10.22 SPA at 10 mithridacy, with 8.97 echoes of extra profit per skeleton.

If you are grinding everything but ribcages from scratch, it is 13.57 SPA at 15 mithridacy, and 12.60 SPA at 10 mithridacy, with 9.14 echoes of extra cost per skeleton.

If you are grinding only wings and pincers from scratch, it is 15.66 SPA at 15 mithridacy, and 14.38 SPA at 10 mithridacy, with 1.35 echoes of extra cost per skeleton.

If you have all parts on hand, it is 20.30 SPA at 15 mithridacy, and 18.26 SPA at 10 mithridacy.

All calculations assume 300 shadowy and persuasive, the ability to remove 4 suspicion per action, and generator skeletons built with 7 brass skulls for bone fragments or 7 sabre toothed skulls for warm amber sold only during bird weeks.

Human ribcages can be obtained via the Advanced Tombs and Tigers method, deep-zee catches can be bought in bulk in the Khanate and disassembled into pincers at the butcher, all other parts can be cloned at the butcher in Ealing Gardens.
