So, following on from my previous post, about 'maybe you need a Rumormonger's network in a hurry' - I did, in fact, smash out a 7 exhaustion amalgamous skeleton, and it would have been more profitable to have waited.

But so it goes. 

This week it's Amalgamous Reptiles. If you are following the spider pope guide, this is a Bulk week. 

For the sake of concocting a Reptile with Amalgamy though, this is actually almost too easy, since [[Helical Thighbone]] are particularly good for lots of Amalgamy, as 2 each, and a reptile... well, has legs. 

A reptile:

One skull
0-4 legs
a tail
Non humanoid skeleton. 
No wings or fins

Our Amalgamy buyers are:

As it's amalgamy week, our sellers of particular interest are:

Rubbery Collector, who likes [[Amalgamy]] x [[Menace]], and pays out in [[Nightsoil of the Bazaar|Nightsoil]] for value, and [[Basket of Rubbery Pies|Rubbery Pies]] for attribute bonus. 
Tentacled Entrepreneur who likes [[Amalgamy]] (squared) and pays out in [[Memory of Distant Shores]] for value, and [[Final Breath|Final Breaths]] for bonus reward. 
Zailor of Particular Interests, who like [[Amalgamy]] x [[Antiquity]] who pays out in [[Nodule of Warm Amber|Warm Amber]], and bonus reward in [[Knob of Scintillack|Knobs of Scintillack]].

The Guest Buyer this week is the Dreary Midnighter, who's buying skeletons without implausibility or amalgamy, and pays in Surface Currency on skeleton value. (Not a particularly interesting choice). 

Of those:

Nightsoil, Final Breaths and Knobs are easy to convert to scrip. 
Rubbery Pies can be turned into scrip, but need a bit more effort (e.g. a pie stall at Ealing). 
Warm Amber is used in the bone market and the ealing butcher, so you might want to get some of that in. 
Memories of Distant Shores can be upconverted to collated research, and turned into bones in Balmoral Woods. 

Reptiles are a fairly good use of those leviathan frames you've been collecting from Heart's Game (fish are maybe better, because +15% on a 312.5E frame is better than +10%), and you can use things with awkward numbers of legs, like a prismatic frame. 

Actually you probably have more of a problem of overshooting the 4 amalgamy threshold for zero exhaustion from a Tentacled Entrepreneur than the other way around, as 2 helical thighs will do that.

So because that's 'too boring' instead I will go for a 7 exhaustion skeleton. That'll 'close' the bone market for this week, but will leave a point left for next week. This is a bit more challenging, because you're limited on legs/skulls etc. However, there's a bit of a 'cheat' here, in that if you add some joints to a skeleton, it increases amalgamy too, and that's good for us here. I'll also try and use up some items that I don't want to hold on for other stuff (e.g. lower value ribcages). 

Our target number to do that is 14 amalgamy, which will give us 510E of 'profit' (392 before bonus - yes, that's an extra 100E from this bonus reward, but it conveniently keeps us slightly below the 8 exhaustion threshold for a 2 week lockout). 

Thorned Ribcage (1 Menace, 1 Amalgamy)
Skull in Coral (2 amalgamy) (Could use pentagrammic skull instead if you've unlocked Upward). 
4x Helical Thighbones 2 amalgamy each
Add 4 more limbs (+2 amalgamy)
Add 4 withered tentacles to fill up the limb slots. 
Obsidian-chitin tail (+1 amalgamy)

You will add a cost of 1 trembling amber, and 400 warm amber because of adding the joints, which WON'T increase the value of your skeleton to compensate. It's one of the few examples of cost that doesn't increase value in the bone market, so I wouldn't normally recommend it. That's 52.5E of 'cost' to pretty much just add 2 amalgamy to the skeleton. However, because that 2 amalgamy pushes us from 12 Amalgamy to 14, it's actually increasing our payout by 141E. The major reason it's not usually 'worth it' is because that's also adding exhaustion as a result. 

But this is more a thought experiment, and if you cared about efficient grinding you'd be following the Spider Pope guide instead!

So with 14 Amalgamy, you're into the Tentacled Entrepreneur for 14 ^ 2.1 * 4 Final Breaths = 1020, and those can be sold directly for scrip or turned into backstory if you happen to need a lot of that for some reason, like a Rumormonger's Network as part of the new content. 

Base value of frame is 'not much' - deliberately - because I'd rather use cheaper parts on a 10% week and more expensive parts on a 15% week where I can. (Ribcage is 12.5E, Skull in Coral is 17.5E, helical thighs are 3E). But there's probably some more optimal ways to do the above, than to create 4 leg slots that then aren't used if you want to use a leviathan frame or similar.
