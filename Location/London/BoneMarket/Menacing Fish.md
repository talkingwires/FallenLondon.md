Another week in the Bone Market, and another reshuffle of what's 'popular'.

This week we have Menacing Fish.

A fish:

has one skull
has no legs or wings 
has 2 or more fins
can have a tail 
Can have tentacles

And it's one of the 15% options, which is IMO a nice opportunity to 'use up' any high value skeletons you've not got a better use for. 

And being [[Menace]] week:

author of gothic tales who likes menace and antiquity, paying out in [[Hinterland Scrip]] and [[Carved Ball of Stygian Ivory|Stygian Ivory]]
rubbery collector who likes menace and amalgamy, and pays in Nightsoil and Rubbery Pies. 
Teller of Terrors for a menace 2.1 payout, paying in Morelways 1872 and Royal Blue Feathers. 

Of the 3 I generally go for the Author of Gothic Tales, because Stygian Ivory can be easily turned into scrip either via the Upper River Bazaar, and is also a sellable in the Khanate for the various grinds involving that market. (Crackling Devices for the Rat Market). 

As I have 'farmed up' a bunch of Leviathans from Heart's Game, that's what I'll be going for today.

Leviathan Frame - 1 Antiquity, 1 menace
Horned Skull - 2 antiquity, 1 menace
2x Amber Crusted Fins 1 Amalgamy, 1 Menace Each

This isn't a great skeleton build, as you've not really got 'enough' attributes to get optimal amounts of bonus rewards 3 antiquity x 4 menace is none the less 14 stygian ivory though. (35e value)

And because it's +15% for being a fish, your baseline 350e value is worth an un-exhaustion-restrained profit of 52.5e

You could use a Sabre-Toothed Skull, and lose a point of antiquity in the process, so it's not 'worth it' on this frame - but might be on a different one where you could get enough attribute points otherwise. 

And all that is easily convertible to scrip, if you're after a hellworm.

If you wanted to add 4 limbs to it, you could go for a 6 fin 'fish'. Then you'd maybe go with:

Leviathan Frame - 1 antiquity, 1 menace
Sabre Tooth Skull - 1 antiquity, 1 menace
Add joints - +2 amalgamy, costing 12.5E + 100 Warm Amber (10E worth) 
6x Fins - 1 amalgamy, 1 menace each

This would put you on 8 menace, 2 antiquity, and you'd get yourself a payout of 20 Ivory. And by using a more expensive skull and more fins worth 12.5E, you'd be on a 450e skeleton - 67.5e profit + 45e of Ivory - but costing yourself 22.5E in the process. So 90E profit overall, but using more raw materials and 5 more actions, vs. the 87.5e version above. 

Going for an Amalgamy * Menace buyer on the other hand would pay out generously, but also rack up quite a bit of Bone Market Exhaustion. But if you did that, the payout in Rubbery Pies would be 170E worth, with 3 points of exhaustion to it's not a horrible plan, I just don't like Pies because of converting them to scrip being more difficult.
