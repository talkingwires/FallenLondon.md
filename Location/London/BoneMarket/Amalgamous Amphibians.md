Bone Market Recipes: Amalgamous Amphibians

You may have seen an incorrect version of this post already. This is the amendment.
Last week was  [Menacing Fish](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallenlondon/comments/wvncf7/bone_market_recipes_menacing_fish/).

This week is Amalgamous Amphibians. 

An Amphibian:

- 4 legs
- 1 skull
- no tails. 
- No arms, wings or fins

It's a fairly easy 'build' but some of the more interesting limbs are locked out.

Note - if you have a Ravenglass Knife, you can add a tail, then remove it again and still get the attribute points. This opens a few more options. 

Also, you can just recently acquire obsidian-chitin tails from heists of the Museum. This is useful, because it's surprisingly hard to get +1 amalgamy otherwise. (Most are even numbers). 

That makes our interesting buyers:

- The Tentacled Entrepreneur - which pays Amalgamy^2.1 (exhaustion based on Amalgamy^2)
- Rubbery Collector, who likes Amalgamy x Menace
- Zailor of Particular Interests, who like Amalgamy x Antiquity

Our goal is to keep exhaustion to zero, with Amalgamy 4 for the Entrepreneur, and the two multiplied <20 for the other two. 
If you don't mind a bit of exhaustion, you can go for amalgamy 7, which will get you 1 point, or 11 that will get you 4 points. 

For the entrepreneur, a nice easy 'recipe':

- Mammoth Chassis (+2 Antiquity)
- Horned Skull (+1 antiquity, +2 menace)
- 2 helical thighs (2 amalgamy each)
- 2 jurassic thighs (1 antiquity each)
- No tail

4 amalgamy for 74 final breaths as your payout (instead of 64 normally). If you wanted to shoot for 7, for 1 point of exhaustion:

- Mammoth (2 Antiquity)
- Skull in Coral (2 amalgamy)
- 2 helical thighs ( 2 amalgamy each)
- 2 unidentified thighs (no attributes)
- Obsidian-chitin tail (1 amalgamy)
- Remove the tail with a Ravenglass knife

That'll get you to 7, and 238 breaths  and one exhaustion. 
Or all in one go, swap the unidentified thighs for 2 more helical, and that should get you to 11 - for 615 final breaths, and 4 bone market exhaustion. Usually best saved for just before Time the Healer arrives. 

In general, the 4 'limbed' frames are optimal for this -  but a human frame will not work. You could use the segmented with just one segment, or the 7 or 8 necked, but I feel those are better used on different weeks. (Segmented is by far the easiest way to make spiders, and given birds can have many skulls, the many skulled skeletons are a lot better in Bird week). 


For the Collector or the zailor, we can shoot for a 2-for-1 we can shoot for 6 amalgamy, 3 menace, 3 antiquity:

- Mammoth frame (2 antiquity)
- Sabre toothed skull (1 menace, 1 antiquity)
- 3 Helical Thighbones (+2 amalgamy each
- 1 unidentified thighbone (Ivory femur would work too, but I'd normally save those for insect week, for a 15% bonus)
- jet Black stinger (+2 menace) 
- remove jet black stinger

This will get you a 6/3/3 which means an 18 + 3 payout from whichever seller you offer it to. You'll probably have correctly figured out that adding and removing the tail is largely irrelevant for the Zailor, so you might as well not bother.
