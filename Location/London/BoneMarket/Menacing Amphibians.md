>Today's bone market reshuffle brings us Menacing Amphibians as the preferred choice. 

>If you follow [The Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjgbbNw_mvDiK_dAY_Ld7lTSDD3QGU1POFAaJ6NXh-8/edit) this is a 'bulk' week in which you wouldn't be farming skeletons at all, and instead stock up.

>But that's not the point of why I write these, so let's try and put together something. 

>An Amphibian:

>* 4 legs
* 1 skull
* no tails. 
* No arms, wings or fins
* You'll need to have researched *A Complete Account of Frogs, Toads, and Other Croaking Beasts* in the lab too. 

>You can attach a tail an truncate it again with at ravenglass knife, which costs actions but can be handly for a couple more attribute points. 

>Amphibians are both somewhat easy, but also oddly strict, so they're not a great choice for some of the stranger skeleton-frames. And at a mere +10%, they're not that profitable either (so typically a reptile would be 'better' in almost every way). 

>Because it's menace week, buyers of interest are 

>* author of gothic tales who likes menace and antiquity 
* rubbery collector who likes menace and amalgamy
* Teller of Terrors for a menace ^2.1 payout. (But as usual exhaustion is without bonus).

>Our target is to have both attributes multiply to less than 20, ideally favouring menace. 

>Or we can go for 4 menace to stay at zero exhaustion.

>So, I as I'm a fan of the Teller of Terror's capacity to be easily fungible to scrip, that's who I'm going to aim for this time - there's no menacing legs, so it's going to be a little challenging to create a 'sufficiently scary' amphibian, and because I have better uses for Mammoths, I'm going to start with a Thorned Ribcage.

>* Thorned ribcage (1 menace, 1 amalgamy)
* Horned Skull (1 antiquity, 2 menace)
* 3 Jurassic legs (1 antiquity each)
* Femur of a Surface Deer (-1 menace)
* Jet black Stinger (2 menace)
* Amputate the stinger. 

>This'll give you 4 menace, 4 antiquity, which'll be zero exhaustion, and score you a 'bonus' reward of 18 doots of Stygian Ivory. (So an extra +2 over the 16 you'd get normally). 

>Not particularly inspiring I guess, Amphibians is just not all that great a week overall, and hard to combine with Menace too. Jurassic thigh instead of femur of deer will put you on a 5x5 which is 1 exhaustion, but will get you a slightly better payout, and ... I guess why not if you're not otherwise farming the exhaustion?
