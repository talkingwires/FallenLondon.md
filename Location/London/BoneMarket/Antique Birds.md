Another week in the BONE ZONE!

This week, Antique Birds are 'the thing'.

Now birds are quite an exciting one, because they're one of a very few that allow any number of skulls.

To be declared a bird:

* 2 wings
* 2 legs

But any number of heads, and can have up to 1 tail. (There's not many frames with room for more than 1, but the prismatic allows for 3, which won't make a valid bird)

Since it's antiquity week, our buyers of interest are:

* An Investment Minded Ambassador, who pays primary reward in [[Memory of Light|Memories of Light]], and secondary reward in Tailfeathers, Brilliant as Flame. She's an Antiquity squared buyer (so pays Ant^2.1 this week).
* An Author of Gothic Tales, who likes Menace x Antiquity. Paying in [[Hinterland Scrip|Scrip]] for the primary reward, and [[Carved Ball of Stygian Ivory|Stygian Ivory]] for the secondary. 
* A Zailor with Particular Interests, who likes Amalgamy x Antiquity, Paying in Warm Amber and Knobs of Scintillack

Our threshold for avoiding exhaustion is - as usual - 4 antiquity for the single attribute buyer, and a product of <20 for the two attribute buyers.

Once upon a time, Fossilized Apes were 'recommended' during antiquity week, but no longer, as the price of Fossilized Forelimbs was increased significantly in the last patch. But this might be a time to use up any leftovers anyway. 

This gets potentially a little tricky, as having 'lots' of skulls can be quite hard to avoid gaining too much exhaustion. Brass Skulls are of course, not ramping up attributes, but they're also making it hard to avoid racking up too much Implausibility. 

... so perhaps it's worth a special mention, that the Colourful Phantasist is in town, and might be interested in things with high implausibility. She's not affected by bone market fluctuations though, so for the purposes of this post, we'll skip over it. But if you did want to sell, 4 of an attribute and 4 implausibility is the limit of what you can sell (e.g. 2 brass skulls worth with 100% mithridacy checks).

So - in terms of 'frames' to build a bird on, the ideal choice would probably be the ribcage with a bouquet of 8 spines - it holds 8 heads, and has the required 4 limbs to be a bird. 

We need to be selective about our skulls, because we don't want to 'blow' our attribute ratio.

Birds are +10% value, which means they're not the best places to 'dump' our high value skulls, but ... at the same time we can use 8 of them, and 10% of 62.5 x 8 is quite nice really, but it's surprisingly hard to get a 'good' mix of attributes without overrunning our limit. 

* [[Ribcage with a Bouquet of Eight Spines]] (2 [[Menace]], 1 [[Amalgamy]])
* 2x [[Bright Brass Skull|Brass Skull]] (2 Implausibility each, if you past the check)
* 4 x [[Sabre-toothed Skull|Sabre-Toothed Skulls]] (1 [[Menace]], 1 [[Antiquity]] each)
* 2 x [[Doubled Skull|Doubled Skulls]] (2 [[Antiquity]], 1 [[Amalgamy]]) 
* 2 x [[Femur of a Surface Deer|Femurs of a Surface Deer ( -1 [[Menace]] each) 
* 2 x [[Bat Wing|Bat Wings]] (-1 [[Menace]] each)
* [[Tomb-Lion's Tail]] (1 [[Antiquity]])

If I'm counting fingers right, that should put you on 9 antiquity, 2 menace, and get you a nice 18 for your secondary payout - for 22 stygian ivory (55E worth, up from 45E in a 'normal' week). 

And you've racked up a whole bundle of expensive bones - 812E or so? So you're getting a bonus 80E 'profit' from it being bird week.

Alternatively we can look at Antiquity x Amalgamy, because there we've got a bit more control - we can avoid amalgamous skulls a little more easily than menacing ones. 

* 8-ball chassis
* 8 x [[Sabre-toothed Skull]] ( 1 [[Menace]], 1 [[Antiquity]] each)
* [[Tomb-Lion's Tail]] (1 [[Antiquity]])
* 2 [[Albatross Wing|Albatross Wings]] (1 [[Amalgamy]] each)
* 2 non antique, non amalgamous leg (unidentified, surface deer, ivory, holy relic).

This should get us 9 antiquity and 2 amalgamy, again getting is 18 items as secondary rewards - uplifted to 22 because of the antiquity fad, and another 80E from being bird week.

If that's a bit rich for your blood - and like me, you don't have plenty of 312E skeletons floating around - then you can do a reasonably good 'bird' from a mammoth frame - which also has the requisite 4 limbs to get you started.

Only one skull though, which means the profit-multiplier isn't as stunning as it could be. 

But:

* [[Mammoth Ribcage]] (2 [[Antiquity]]) 
* [[Sabre-toothed Skull]] (1 [[Antiquity]], 1 [[Menace]])
* 2 [[Wing of a Young Terror Bird]] (1 [[Antiquity]], 1 [[Menace]] each)
* 1 [[Femur of a Jurassic Beast|Jurassic Femur]] (1 [[Antiquity]]) 
* any non-antiquity-non-menace leg. (Ivory, Helical, unidentified)
* Declare bird
* sell to author of gothic tales. 

That'll put you on a 125E or so skeleton (so 12E from 'bird'), with 6 antiquity, 3 menace. That'll get you 21 stygian ivory (not 22 as above, because it's 6x3.5 instead of 9x2.5). But still an extra 7.5E on top of the 45E of 'normal' profit. 

It's probably worth noting - a 7 necked skeleton *also* works for this, as it comes with 2 legs built in. You need to use both limbs for wings though, sl your flexibility is a little less. 

But still:

* Skeleton with 7 necks - 1 menace, 2 amalgamy, 2 legs
* 7 sabre toothed skulls (1 menace, 1 antiquity each)
* 2 wings of a terror bird (1 menace, 1 antiquity each). 
* Declare as bird.

This gives you 9 antiquity, 2 amalgamy, which is ideal for selling to the Zailor, for a nice big pile of warm amber, and as above - 22 (instead of 18) knobs of scintillack as your secondary rewards. 

You can also sell to an author of gothic tales, with your whopping 10 menace too, but you'll lock yourself out of the bonemarket for a while. But for 235E worth of Stygian ivory (94 units) maybe that's worth a week off. (it'll get you 5 exhaustion, so you will come into next Time the Healer with 1 left over).
