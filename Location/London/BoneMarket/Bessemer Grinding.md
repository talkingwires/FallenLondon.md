# Selling to an Enthusiast of the Ancient World
One more lengthy way of acquiring [[Bessemer Steel Ingot|Ingots]] is to visit the The Bone Market, assemble skeleton with at least 1 Antiquity and sell it to an Enthusiast of the Ancient World. Trying to improve Antiquity is not that useful, focus on the Skeleton Value instead.

| Recipe                                                                         	| Value 	| Ignots  	|
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-------	|---------	|
| [[Headless Skeleton]]<br>[[Horned Skull]]                                              	| 1500  	| 30      	|
| [[Headless Skeleton]]<br>[[Sabre-toothed Skull]]<br><br><br><br>                      	| 6500  	| 130     	|
| [[Human Ribcage]]<br>[[Horned Skull]]<br>2x [[Human Arm]]<br>2x [[Unidentified Thigh Bone]]   	| 3200  	| 64      	|
| [[Human Ribcage]]<br>[[Sabre-toothed Skull]]<br>2x [[Ivory Humerus]]<br>2x [[Ivory Femur]] 	| 23500 	| 470     	|

For that the last recipe, the Sabre-toothed Skull can be bought from the Enthusiast of the Ancient World (but needs a bit of Hinterland Scrip grinding first). Ivory bones are obtainable from A Familiar Bohemian Sculptress in exchange for a few Parabolan Orange-apples ( 1 x Parabolan Orange-apple ( 1100 x Bone Fragments) for 1 x Ivory Humerus, 3 x Parabolan Orange-apples ( 3300 x Bone Fragments) and 750 x Bone Fragments for 1 x Ivory Femur).
