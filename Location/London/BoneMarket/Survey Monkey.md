Survey Monkey (AKA Monkey with Two Tails)

This method is highly efficient, but requires membership in Sophia’s club:

First, go to the Woods in Balmoral, and enter by using two batches of [[Volume of Collated Research|Collated Research]]. Once inside, Wander the Glades until you obtain twelve levels of Tracking. Then proceed to Walk in moonlight, and track down a Fox—this will net you a Thorned Ribcage and a pair of Knotted Humeri from the Deviless

The leftover Doubled Skulls should be used on other projects

(Optional step) For every Thorned Ribcage obtained in this way, obtain another one by preparing Surveys in your Lab (use the longer experiment) spending them through either Digs in the Magistracy of the Evenlode card or the Dig near Station VIII permanent branch

During an [[Antiquity]] or [[Menace]] week assemble a Monkey skeleton by combining a [[Thorned Ribcage]] with a [[Bright Brass Skull|Brass Skull]], three [[Fossilised Forelimb,|Fossilised Forelimbs]] (bought from The Upper River Exchange), a [[Knotted Humerus]], and a [[Jet Black Stinger]], and sell it to an Author of Gothic Tales

The Stingers should be obtained from Sophia’s club card—it’s best to build a large stockpile (at least a few hundred), and then switch to another Club (presumably the Stags)
