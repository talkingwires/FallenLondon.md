So this is more like a theorycraft (although I'm fairly sure the numbers add up). And if you happen to get bored of a 6 echoes-per-action grind or something.

Bird week is - usually - an amazing week for the bone market, for one simple reason: Birds can have as many skulls as you like.

So right now is great if you want to take almost any skeleton, slap a huge number of skulls on it and a couple of wings, and cash in.

Each 62.5E Brass skull is 'profiting' by 6 echoes, which is tasty.

The only downside is they add implausibility, so a 8 skulled monstrosity might be really hard to 'sell' since each brass skull adds at least 2, and possibly 6 implausibility.(Mithridacy 10 needed for the 2).

As it's amalgamy week, our sellers of particular interest are:

    Rubbery Collector, who likes Amalgamy x Menace
    Tentacled Entrepreneur who likes Amalgamy (squared).
    Zailor of Particular Interests, who like Amalgamy x Antiquity

If we want to sell to the Entrepreneur, we aim for 4 amalgamy - to keep to zero exhaustion - and any number of 'other stuff'.

Birds can have any number of skulls. But only 2 legs And only 2 wings.

So:

    Skeleton with 7 necks. (2 legs 'built in': 2 amalgamy, 1 menace)
    3 Brass Skulls (no secondary qualities) (62.5E)
    3 Sabre-Toothed Skulls (1 antiquity, 1 menace, 62.5E each)
    1 Skull in Coral (+2 Amalgamy) 17.5E base value
    2 wings of a young terror bird. (+1 menace + 1 antiquity each).

You'll have 4 amalgamy - which is worth 74 Final Breaths (I think. 42.1 * 4), and a valuable skeleton that's increased by 10% because it's bird week. This value is paid in memories of distant shores, which are useful for upconverting to Collated Research - which you can use in Balmoral to farm more skeletons in the woods.

For the collector or Zailor, we want to do something similar, but actually ideally will optimise for amalgamy.

6 x 3 or 9 x 2 keeps you below the exhaustion threshold.

Albatross wings at 12.5E can also give you amalgamy, so actually the hard part here is keeping below the threshold of exhaustion. (of course if you don't care, just slap skulls in coral on, and be done with it!)

    Skeleton with 7 next (2 Amalgamy, 1 menace)
    2 Skull in Coral (+2 amalgamy each).
    3 Brass Skulls (No amalgamy, 62.5E value)
    Sabre tooth skull x2 (1 menace, 1 antiquity)
    2x wings of a terror bird (+1 menace, 1 antiquity each)

NOTE: This will blow the 'cap', and cost you exhaustion, so we need to use the Patent Osteological Sand Wax (from the upper river) to reduce the menace by 2 points. Make your Skeleton less dreadful

This will leave you with 6 amalgamy 3 menace, and an expensive base 'frame' so the Collector will pay out 6x3.5 = 21 (instead of 18) rubbery pies. And the rest will be in nightsoil, which is useful because it's convertible 'at value' to scrip in the upper river. (1 soil => 1 scrip).

For the Zailor we want to do the same thing, but with antiquity. The recipe is similar:

    Skeleton with 7 necks (2 amalgamy, 1 menace)
    3 Sabre toothed skulls (1 menace, 1 amalgamy)
    2 Skull in Coral (2 amalgamy each)
    2 Brass Skulls. (Just value)
    2 wings of a young terror bird (1 menace, 1 antiquity each)
    Carve away some evidence of age with a Scrimshander Knife (seasonal) -2 antiquity.

And this time use a scrimshander knife, that hopefully you have from the fruits of the zee festival, to carve away some evidence of age.

The mix of skulls is slightly different because the base frame has one menace, and the zailor doesn't care. So we need the extra point of menace so we're on 6 amalgamy, 3 antiquity so we get 21 knobs of scintillack payout (18 in a normal week).

Alternatively, you could use Albatross wings, and use Lithification Liquid which might be preferable despite needing to be used twice, simply because it's not a seasonal item - it's available in the upper river. This also has the advantage that Albatross wings are worth more, so you get a bit more out of that 10% multiplier for being a bird.

The zailor also pays in warm amber, which is generally quite handy when doing skeleton things. I have no idea if that'll be useful for the newly opening museum, but if you do end up needing some in a hurry it's a good opportunity.

And of course, if you don't care about exhaustion, then just slapping together something with a big pile of Skulls in Coral, and some Albatross wings will give you a a generous payout. 20 amalagamy or so, will get you ~1000E of final breaths, but it'll also get you locked out the bone market for 4 weeks or so. (I think? Formula seems to suggest 16 exhaustion).
